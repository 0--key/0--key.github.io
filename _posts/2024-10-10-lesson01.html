<p>
In this article, I intend to explain the <b>time-consuming</b> process of
learning a foreign language as a specific example of acquiring any
skill. Indeed, you can acquire any skill through deliberate practice,
and learning a foreign language is no exception. If you engage
regularly in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the
language, you will inevitably gain proficiency over time.
</p>

<p>
Acquiring a foreign language involves <i>consistent and deliberate
effort</i>. Much like mastering a musical instrument or becoming skilled
at a sport, learning a language requires dedication and practice. The
key is to immerse yourself in various language activities and to
persist with patience and perseverance. Each step you take, from
listening to native speakers to practicing writing, combines to build
your overall proficiency.
</p>

<p>
It's a journey that demands time and effort, but the rewards—such as
cultural understanding and enhanced communication skills — are well
worth it. My role is to whet your appetite for learning and transform
this lifelong journey into an <code>exhilarating adventure</code>, rather than a
dull and tedious routine.
</p>

<p>
By igniting your curiosity and passion for language learning, I aim to
make this process engaging and enjoyable. With the right approach,
each step in your language acquisition can feel like an exciting
discovery, opening up new worlds and perspectives. I am here to guide
you, supporting you in overcoming challenges and celebrating your
progress, so that the path to mastering a foreign language becomes a
rewarding and enriching experience.

<div id="outline-container-org2e42fbb" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2e42fbb">The First Words</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2e42fbb">
<p>
As you may observe, all humans are born without the ability to speak
and typically begin to produce their first words at around the age of
two years, or even later. It doesn't take a prophet to conclude that
<b>children learn</b> both how to speak and how to understand
language. While this fact is quite obvious, let's take a closer look
at <b>how</b> they achieve it.
</p>

<p>
Children are naturally immersed in a language-rich environment for at
least 12 hours every day. They generally sleep for about 10 hours,
spend approximately 2 hours in quieter activities like bathing and
eating, and devote the remaining time to actively engaging with
parents, relatives, siblings, peers, and others. When you consider
this, children are exposed to language for about 12 hours a day,
<span class="underline">adding up to over 4,000 hours each year</span>. Given this vast exposure,
it's no surprise that children acquire language skills rapidly.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
So, naturally, by the age of six, a child typically knows about 2,500
to 5,000 words.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This range can vary greatly depending on various factors such as the
child's exposure to language, the richness of their language
environment, and individual differences in learning pace. Children who
are more frequently engaged in conversations, read to regularly, and
encouraged to explore language tend to have larger vocabularies.
Continual exposure and practice are key to expanding a child's
vocabulary and language skills.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that at this stage, a child typically <b>cannot
read or write</b>. Therefore, all of their linguistic knowledge is
acquired <b>only</b> through listening and asking questions.
</p>

<p>
By examining the process more closely, we can observe that the 
approximately 4,000 hours of immersion in a language-rich environment 
form the foundation for acquiring a vocabulary of around 2,500 to 5,000 
words.
</p>

<p>
These extensive hours of exposure to language are critical as they 
provide the necessary groundwork for children to build their linguistic 
abilities. During this time, children are constantly absorbing new 
words, phrases, and meanings through interactions, conversations, and 
listening to others. This natural and immersive language acquisition 
serves as the basis upon which they expand their vocabulary and 
communication skills.
</p>

<p>
The consistent daily interactions ensure that children are continuously 
engaged with the language, allowing for gradual yet steady vocabulary 
growth. This immersion not only helps them learn words but also aids in 
understanding context, improving comprehension, and fostering the 
ability to use language effectively in various situations.

<h2 id="orgedbbc9f">An Advanced Vocabulary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgedbbc9f">
<blockquote>
<p>
So, naturally, by the age of six, a child typically knows about 2,500
to 5,000 words.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In that time, by the age of six, children begin attending classes in 
primary school. It is no secret that this is when teachers start 
to instruct them in the fundamentals of reading and writing.
</p>

<p>
This transition marks a significant milestone in a child's educational
journey. At this stage, children are introduced to the alphabet, basic
phonics, and simple words, setting the foundation for their literacy
skills.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The process is carefully structured to gradually build their
ability to recognize letters, sound out words, and <b>eventually read
and write independently</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The introduction of reading and writing not only enhances their
linguistic capabilities but also opens <i>the door to exploring new
ideas and knowledge</i>.
