<blockquote>
<p>
A feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network wherein
connections between the units do <i>not</i> form a cycle. As such, it is
different from recurrent neural networks.
</p>

<p>
The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of
artificial neural network devised. In this network, the information
moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through
the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles
or loops in the network.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These are the commonest type of neural network in practical
applications.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first layer is the input and the last layer is the output.</li>
<li>If there is more than one hidden layer, we call them “deep” neural
networks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
They compute a series of transformations that change the
similarities between cases.

function of the activities in the layer below.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network
where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an
internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic
temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use
their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. This
makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented connected handwriting
recognition or speech recognition.
</p>

These have directed cycles in their connection graph.

(to whet your interest!)
</p>

<p>
Ilya Sutskever (2011) trained a special type of recurrent neural net
to predict the next character in a sequence.
</p>

<p>
After training for a long time on a string of half a billion
characters from English Wikipedia, he got it to generate new text.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It generates by predicting the probability distribution for the
next character and then sampling a character from this
distribution.</li>
<li>The next slide shows an example of the kind of text it generates.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Notice how much it knows!Some text generated one character at a time

had been overshadowed by CNL, and several Irish intelligence agencies
in the Mediterranean region. However, on the Victoria, Kings Hebrew

<h3 id="orgfe167c9">Symmetrically connected networks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfe167c9">
<p>
These are like recurrent networks, but the connections between units
are symmetrical (they have the same weight in both directions).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>John Hopfield (and others) realized that symmetric networks are
much easier to analyze than recurrent networks.</li>
<li>They are also more restricted in what they can do. because they
obey an energy function.</li>

For example, they cannot model cycles.
Symmetrically connected nets without hidden units are called
“Hopfield nets”.

Add an extra component with value 1 to each input vector. The “bias” weight

  Each time the perceptron makes a mistake, the current weight
vector moves to decrease its squared distance from every weight
vector in the “generously feasible” region.
  The squared distance decreases by at least the squared length of
the input vector.
  So after a finite number of mistakes, the weight vector must lie in the

What perceptrons can’t do

Kevin SwerskyThe limitations of Perceptrons
  If you are allowed to choose the features by hand and if you use
enough features, you can do almost anything.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For binary input vectors, we can have a separate feature unit for</li>
</ul>
<p>
each of the exponentially many binary vectors and so we can
make any possible discrimination on binary input vectors.
  This type of table look-up won’t generalize.
  But once the hand-coded features have been determined, there are
very strong limitations on what a perceptron can learn.What binary threshold neurons cannot do
  A binary threshold output unit cannot even tell if two single bit features are
the same!
Positive cases (same):
(1,1) à 1;
(0,0) à 1
Negative cases (different): (1,0) à 0;
(0,1) à 0

under translation with wrap-around
  Suppose we just use pixels as

  Can a binary threshold unit

pattern BSketch of a proof that a binary decision unit cannot
discriminate patterns with the same number of on pixels
(assuming translation with wraparound)
• 
• 
• 
For pattern A, use training cases in all possible translations.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each pixel will be activated by 4 different translations of pattern A.</li>
<li>So the total input received by the decision unit over all these patterns will</li>

<li>Each pixel will be activated by 4 different translations of pattern B.</li>
<li>So the total input received by the decision unit over all these patterns will</li>

But to discriminate correctly, every single case of pattern A must provide more
input to the decision unit than every single case of pattern B.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is impossible if the sums over cases are the same.Why this result is devastating for Perceptrons</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The whole point of pattern recognition is to recognize patterns despite
transformations like translation.
  Minsky and Papert’s “Group Invariance Theorem” says that the part of
a Perceptron that learns cannot learn to do this if the transformations
form a group.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Translations with wrap-around form a group.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To deal with such transformations, a Perceptron needs to use multiple
feature units to recognize transformations of informative sub-patterns.

<li>So the tricky part of pattern recognition must be solved by the</li>
</ul>

hand-coded feature detectors, not the learning procedure.Learning with hidden units
• 
• 
Networks without hidden units are very limited in the input-output mappings they
can learn to model.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More layers of linear units do not help. Its still linear.</li>
<li>Fixed output non-linearities are not enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We need multiple layers of adaptive, non-linear hidden units. But how can we
train such nets?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We need an efficient way of adapting all the weights, not just the last layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is hard.
