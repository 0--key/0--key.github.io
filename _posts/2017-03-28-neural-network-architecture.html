<blockquote>
<p>
A feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network wherein
connections between the units do <i>not</i> form a cycle. As such, it is
different from recurrent neural networks.
</p>

<p>
The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of
artificial neural network devised. In this network, the information
moves in only one direction, forward, from the input nodes, through
the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles
or loops in the network.
</p>

<p>
These are the commonest type of neural network in practical
applications.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first layer is the input and the last layer is the output.</li>
<li>If there is more than one hidden layer, we call them “deep” neural

similarities between cases.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org31300b4">
<blockquote>
<p>
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network
where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an
internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic
temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use
their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. This
makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented connected handwriting
recognition or speech recognition.
</p>

These have directed cycles in their connection graph.

Ilya Sutskever (2011) trained a special type of recurrent neural net
to predict the next character in a sequence.

After training for a long time on a string of half a billion
characters from English Wikipedia, he got it to generate new text.

  To deal with hyper-planes in a 14-dimensional space, visualize a 3-D

extra complexity as going from 2-D to 3-D.Weight-space

  A point in the space represents a particular setting of all the weights.

  Each time the perceptron makes a mistake, the current weight
vector moves to decrease its squared distance from every weight
vector in the “generously feasible” region.
  The squared distance decreases by at least the squared length of
the input vector.
  So after a finite number of mistakes, the weight vector must lie in the
feasible region if this region exists.Neural Networks for Machine Learning

What perceptrons can’t do
Geoffrey Hinton
with
Nitish Srivastava
Kevin SwerskyThe limitations of Perceptrons
  If you are allowed to choose the features by hand and if you use
enough features, you can do almost anything.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For binary input vectors, we can have a separate feature unit for</li>
</ul>
<p>
each of the exponentially many binary vectors and so we can
make any possible discrimination on binary input vectors.
  This type of table look-up won’t generalize.
  But once the hand-coded features have been determined, there are
very strong limitations on what a perceptron can learn.What binary threshold neurons cannot do
  A binary threshold output unit cannot even tell if two single bit features are
the same!
Positive cases (same):
(1,1) à 1;
(0,0) à 1
Negative cases (different): (1,0) à 0;
(0,1) à 0
  The four input-output pairs give four inequalities that are impossible to
satisfy:

  Suppose we just use pixels as

  Can a binary threshold unit
discriminate between different
patterns that have the same
number of on pixels?

pattern BSketch of a proof that a binary decision unit cannot
discriminate patterns with the same number of on pixels
(assuming translation with wraparound)
• 
• 
• 
For pattern A, use training cases in all possible translations.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each pixel will be activated by 4 different translations of pattern A.</li>
<li>So the total input received by the decision unit over all these patterns will</li>
</ul>
<p>
be four times the sum of all the weights.
For pattern B, use training cases in all possible translations.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each pixel will be activated by 4 different translations of pattern B.</li>
<li>So the total input received by the decision unit over all these patterns will</li>
</ul>
<p>
be four times the sum of all the weights.
But to discriminate correctly, every single case of pattern A must provide more
input to the decision unit than every single case of pattern B.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is impossible if the sums over cases are the same.Why this result is devastating for Perceptrons</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The whole point of pattern recognition is to recognize patterns despite
transformations like translation.
  Minsky and Papert’s “Group Invariance Theorem” says that the part of
a Perceptron that learns cannot learn to do this if the transformations
form a group.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Translations with wrap-around form a group.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To deal with such transformations, a Perceptron needs to use multiple
feature units to recognize transformations of informative sub-patterns.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So the tricky part of pattern recognition must be solved by the</li>
</ul>
<p>
hand-coded feature detectors, not the learning procedure.Learning with hidden units
• 
• 
Networks without hidden units are very limited in the input-output mappings they
can learn to model.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More layers of linear units do not help. Its still linear.</li>
<li>Fixed output non-linearities are not enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We need multiple layers of adaptive, non-linear hidden units. But how can we
train such nets?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We need an efficient way of adapting all the weights, not just the last layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is hard.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learning the weights going into hidden units is equivalent to learning features.</li>

should do.
