Welcome to Solved, the self-help podcast for smart people. My name is
Mark Manson, threetime number one New York Times bestselling author,
and this is my co-host and longtime lead researcher, Drew Bernie. Now,
Drew and I have been in the personal growth and mental health space
for a combined 30 years now. And we've had enough. We've had enough of
the empty promises, and fake solutions. Every episode of Solved, our
goal is to create the most comprehensive evidence-based valued
delivering podcast on earth on that specific topic. And today's topic
is procrastination. Now, the catch of Solved is that whatever topic we
cover, our goal is that it is the last time you will ever feel a need
to listen to a podcast on that topic. And this is the last time we can
make an episode covering this topic. Therefore, our promise to you is
that if you make the commitment to get through the entire episode and
implement the advice, your procrastination will be [Music] solved.

Drew, I have two things to say before we get started. Okay. Before we
solve procrastination for the entire world. You're welcome
everybody. Uh first thing is uh so listeners don't know this but this
is the second episode that's going out of this podcast but it this is
actually the first one we're recording and uh ironically we
procrastinated this episode like three months. How many months did it
take us to shoot this thing? Pretty close to that. Yeah. So be
confident listener that uh your your hosts are are experts very
familiar with the topic you're about to
discuss. Yes. Yes. Exactly.
</p>

<p>
Uh, and then the second thing I want to say is is just I want to get
in before all of the comments from people who are going to say, "Oh,
I'll listen to this later. You're not funny. You're not clever. The
same joke. I've been doing this for 15 years. Every time I create any
content around procrastination, the first comment is always, "Oh, I'll
get to this later." And I'm like, "Yeah, you're very cute." Those
people haven't even made it that far yet, though. This far yet. So,
yeah, that's true. So, All right. So, today is procrastination. We are
solving procrastination. Just a reminder to the listener, the whole
premise of this podcast is that this is the last podcast that you
should ever have to listen to on this topic. Drew and I and our
research team have gone just absurdly in depth researching trying to
understand this topic. It is, this episode is absolutely
comprehensive. It is everything you need to know about
procrastination. and then some. Uh, you're probably going to want to
vomit when you hear the word procrastination by the end of this. But
the goal is that you don't have to ever listen to anything about
procrastination ever again. You don't have to read another book. You
don't have to take another seminar. It's all here.
</p>

<p>
So, first some statistics. Procrastination is something that pretty
much everybody struggles with. This is not surprising. 95% of adults
report procrastinating at least some of the time. To me, the most
surprising part of that stat is who the are the 5%? Yeah, show me
that. They're liars. Who are these superhuman robots that never
procrastinate? Uh, yeah, I think 5% of people are liars. Um, 42% of
adults report procrastinating regularly. Uh, and then 25% of adults
report being chronic procrastinators, which is essentially means that
you are just literally procrastinating everything all the time, right?
anything you try to do you end up procrastinating which that is that's
a shocking amount 25% of people. So this is a huge problem. This is
like this is a massive affliction that you know gets to us all. Um so
some of the things that we're going to go through procrastination as a
topic is really interesting because it it is it is such a common human
occurrence that there is thought on it going back 2500 years.
</p>

<p>
So, we went back 200 years and we're going to cover basically the
entire corpus of human thought and approach towards procrastination uh
since the beginning of civilization. And it's actually kind of
surprising because a lot of things that we take to be true or a lot of
our assumptions of what procrastination is are relatively
modern. They're not they're they're pretty recent and and and you know
people in the ancient world or people in medieval times wouldn't
necessarily agree with us and how we approach uh the topic of
procrastination.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately we're going to get to the bottom of what is
procrastination. What like fundamentally like what is happening in
your brain? What is happening psychologically when you're
procrastinating something? When you're not doing the thing you know
you should be doing uh and why does it happen? Why is it even
possible? Right? like if I know something is good for me, like why is
it possible that I can choose not to do that? That that like kind of
doesn't make sense in a in a certain philosophical way.
</p>

<p>
Of course, we're going to cover all the latest research on
procrastination. We're actually going to cover the entire history of
research on procrastination. Uh and because a lot of it got it wrong
and a lot of the conventional wisdom and typical self-help advice
today is based on that old research that got it wrong. And the new
research is says some things quite different than uh maybe what you're
expecting. And of course, we are going to go through at least a dozen
different tactics and strategies that the listener can implement uh to
help lessen procrastination in their lives. Uh I think if there's one
thing that I've learned preparing for this episode, Drew, is that I
don't think procrastination's ever something that we just like
completely get rid of.
</p>

<p>
I think that it is it just seems to be kind of a side effect or a cost
of being humans who have agency and have complex brains. Um we'll get
more into that, but I do think it <i>is incumbent on all of us</i> to do
all the things that we can to lessen or mitigate the procrastination
in our lives. And I do think that is very much attainable for most
people uh relatively quickly.
</p>

<p>
So before we get into it, anything you want to add, Drew? Um, what are
you most excited for? I mean, this what are you procrastinating? Oh,
god. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. This is a very common, very
pervasive problem. And um, we all struggle with it. And I think
there's just there's a tragedy kind of a tragic side to it as well cuz
you know what what else is there to do but do the things you want to
do in life, right? And then we put those things those very things
off.
</p>

<p>
So, I think a lot of people are going to find a there's just going to
be a big nodfest going on while you're listening to this. And um yeah,
I'm excited to get into it because it's something I struggle with
quite a bit. I don't know if I'm a chronic procrastinator, but there's
chronic strains of procrastination that I sometimes run into for
sure. Sure. Um I have a lot of experience with this just being an
author, a self-employed person um for my entire career. So, we'll
we'll get into that.
</p>

<p>
And you mentioned something which is like kind of the tragedy of it is
that what we we'll actually discover later on the episode is that the
proportion of procrastination is actually uh directly correlated to
how important we see a task being in our lives. So it's like
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
the more important the task is the more likely we are to procrastinate
it
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
which is so screwed up right like like that's so unfair. Why does that
happen? Yeah.
</p>

<p>
We'll dig into why that is but yeah it's fascinating. But before we
dive in, uh there's going to be a lot of information in this
podcast. And between me and you and our research team, I think we went
through like what 13 14 books and 100 research articles. So to help
everyone get through this, we've put together a companion PDF
guide. It's 65 pages, includes a full summary of the show, all of our
citations and references, has book recommendations, and it includes
some practical takeaways and lessons as well. So, if you're listening
to this, you can get the PDF guide for free by going to
solvedodcast.com/procrastination. That's

if you want to get through there. All right, let's get started.

<div id="outline-container-orgf33e82c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf33e82c">What exactly is procrastination?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf33e82c">
<p>
Okay, so let's start off with uh a couple definitions first because it
it I was actually surprised how hard it was to actually pin down a
technical definition of procrastination. And even the one that I
chose, as we'll see, there's a little bit of wiggle room with it. So,
there's a researcher named Pier Steel in up in Canada. He did a big
meta analysis in 2007, which is basically what a meta analysis is is
for listeners is that it's when a researcher takes all of the the
relevant studies or data and then kind of like finds a way to combine
them into like a super study. So this guy still did this in 2007 and
he crafted this definition of procrastination based on all the
research at the time which is this
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
procrastination is the act of unnecessarily delaying something despite
knowing that there could be negative consequences for doing
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
so and when I look at this I kind of like break it down into three
factors.
</p>

<p>
So the first factor is an <i>unnecessary delay</i>, right? I think this is
important because prioritization is not procrastination. Like if my
plan is to uh write a a script this morning but uh then my wife gets
in a car accident and I have to go to the hospital like that's not
procrastination because something more important has now
interfered. It's only when the delay is completely unnecessary uh and
fabricated.
</p>

<p>
Um the second one is that there are <i>negative consequences</i>. So a lot
of times when you delay something there actually are not negative
consequences. There are plenty of things that you can delay and
there's actually nothing that immediately there's no immediate
feedback that makes you feel bad for that. I think this is why so many
people procrastinate uh things like working out or eating well because
the that feedback loop is so insanely long. You know it's like 10 20
30 years before you actually experience the repercussion for that
decision. uh it's very easy to convince yourself that like there is no
downside to eating the pizza tonight and uh sitting on the couch for
another day.
</p>

<p>
Uh and then finally the third factor is <i>despite knowing</i> and this is
where it gets tricky.
</p>

<p>
Like I actually found this whole definition very interesting because
all three of these factors are <i>ultimately subjective</i>. Like who says
a delay is unnecessary? Who's to decide what's necessary and what's
not necessary, right? Who's to say what a negative consequence is?
Like you say potato, I say potato. And who says that you're aware or
that you know?
</p>

<p>
My personal experience is that most of my procrastination is I'm I'm
usually bullshitting myself on all three of these factors. I've
convinced myself that there is no negative consequence that's going to
happen or the negative consequence is very minor. It's not a big
deal. I've convinced myself that the delay is actually extremely
necessary. Like when else am I going to be able to watch this Netflix
show if if not for right now?  And and then of course I myself of
saying that like I'm aware I know that this is going to cause a
negative. It's like well who knows, right? Like maybe you know a book
will write itself, right? It happens all the time.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I definitely ran into this too when talking with people about
this, you know, kind of prepping with this and just talking with
people around my life too. I definitely ran into this. They're like,
"Well, is it so bad that you put this off?  is I there was a lot of
that that goes into it.
</p>

<p>
So yeah, it's very subjective. It's Yeah. And it it is there's a whole
question around this of of awareness and knowledge uh which is
actually very much well we we'll get into that. We're getting a little
bit ahead of myself. So the other thing that kind of surprised me and
I guess well I I guess it makes sense is that there there is a
cultural element to this um that I think is worth discussing at least
just for a few minutes especially because I know the the audience for
this podcast is extremely international.
</p>

<p>
So it turns out that procrastination is to a certain extent
<i>culturally defined or culturally relative</i>. There are some cultures
where showing up late it's not a huge deal. Turning something in late
is not really judged or viewed as as something negative. Um, it
actually reminded me, so I I lived in Brazil for a few years. My wife
is Brazilian and and it's one of the things that drove me crazy as an
American down there is that if you if you ever do a business meeting
with a Brazilian, um, first of all, they show up like 20 minutes
late. Uh, then they spend the first 20 minutes like talking about
their weekend and uh, telling you about like their kids soccer game
and uh, you know, asking you what kind of beer you like. And uh and
then it's like not until like minute 45 that you actually get to the
thing that you're supposed to be talking about. And what's interesting
down there is that if you ever like cut try to cut that time down,
they see it as as impolite and rude. Like they see you as doing
something wrong.
</p>

<p>
Um whereas coming from American culture where I'm like, "Dude, I was
here at 10:00 a.m. It's 10:45. We still haven't even like talked about
the the business thing." I see it as rude that they're like wasting my
time. So this concept of time and punctuality uh is very culturally
dependent.
</p>

<p>
And what I found interesting there there's a a social psychologist
from from the Netherlands named Gear Hof who did a bunch of work on
just like cultural factors. He I think he called it I think it's
called <i>cultural dimensions</i> theory or something like that. And um he
talked about how certain cultures have different orientations towards
time and they have different understandings of like what is something
that's done on time or not. Um, so some cultures very much
prioritize.
</p>

<p>
So like western cultures or like Anglo-Saxon cultures very much
prioritize uh like following the clock. Like if I say we're going to
do a thing at 11:30 and you show up at 11:35 to me, you've now delayed
things unnecessarily. It's causing negative consequences. So on and so
on. It's procrastination. Some cultures, if you say 11:30 and they
show up at 11:40, as long as they show up in a way that's like feels
justified or is like emotionally consistent uh with the people around
them, it's not seen as being late, you know?
</p>

<p>
It's like, oh well, yeah, we were going to be here 15 minutes ago, but
like uh I was hanging out with my my my brother and my cousin, and we
were having a great conversation. Um and so it just took longer. And
like that's seen as a completely justified response.
</p>

<p>
And so it's interesting that I guess coming back to the subjectivity
of procrastination, some cultures see it very strictly in terms of
tasks getting completed on time and some cultures see it more in terms
of like emotions and relationships. like in Brazil, if I don't sit
there and kind of chitchat for 20 minutes, um that is seen as some
sort of productive failure because I'm not doing the work to maintain
the relationship with that person. Okay. Yeah. Um anyway, it's just
very interesting. We're not going to spend a ton of time on this, but
I like I said, I'm bringing it up simply because we do have a big
international audience.
</p>

<p>
There are going to be people listening to this in Latin America and
the Middle East and the Mediterranean and some of these places that
are not so rigid with the clock itself. They're more kind of
emotional, social and emotionally based. Um, and it's just worth
considering. And I think it it really just comes back to I think
probably a more effective way to just frame this entire discussion is
why do we consistently fail at doing the things we wish we could do,
right? Like we have things that we know are good for us and we want to
do them yet we don't do them.
