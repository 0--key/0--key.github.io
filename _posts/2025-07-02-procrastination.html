Welcome to Solved, the self-help podcast for smart people. My name is
Mark Manson, threetime number one New York Times bestselling author,
and this is my co-host and longtime lead researcher, Drew Bernie. Now,
Drew and I have been in the personal growth and mental health space
for a combined 30 years now. And we've had enough. We've had enough of
the empty promises, and fake solutions. Every episode of Solved, our
goal is to create the most comprehensive evidence-based valued
delivering podcast on earth on that specific topic. And today's topic
is procrastination. Now, the catch of Solved is that whatever topic we
cover, our goal is that it is the last time you will ever feel a need
to listen to a podcast on that topic. And this is the last time we can
make an episode covering this topic. Therefore, our promise to you is
that if you make the commitment to get through the entire episode and
implement the advice, your procrastination will be [Music] solved.

<p>
Drew, I have two things to say before we get started. Okay. Before we
solve procrastination for the entire world. You're welcome
everybody. Uh first thing is uh so listeners don't know this but this
is the second episode that's going out of this podcast but it this is
actually the first one we're recording and uh ironically we
procrastinated this episode like three months. How many months did it
take us to shoot this thing? Pretty close to that. Yeah. So be
confident listener that uh your your hosts are are experts very
familiar with the topic you're about to
discuss. Yes. Yes. Exactly.
</p>

<p>
Uh, and then the second thing I want to say is is just I want to get
in before all of the comments from people who are going to say, "Oh,
I'll listen to this later. You're not funny. You're not clever. The
same joke. I've been doing this for 15 years. Every time I create any
content around procrastination, the first comment is always, "Oh, I'll
get to this later." And I'm like, "Yeah, you're very cute." Those
people haven't even made it that far yet, though. This far yet. So,
yeah, that's true. So, All right. So, today is procrastination. We are
solving procrastination. Just a reminder to the listener, the whole
premise of this podcast is that this is the last podcast that you
should ever have to listen to on this topic. Drew and I and our
research team have gone just absurdly in depth researching trying to
understand this topic. It is, this episode is absolutely
comprehensive. It is everything you need to know about
procrastination. and then some. Uh, you're probably going to want to
vomit when you hear the word procrastination by the end of this. But
the goal is that you don't have to ever listen to anything about
procrastination ever again. You don't have to read another book. You
don't have to take another seminar. It's all here.
</p>

<p>
So, first some statistics. Procrastination is something that pretty
much everybody struggles with. This is not surprising. 95% of adults
report procrastinating at least some of the time. To me, the most
surprising part of that stat is who the are the 5%? Yeah, show me
that. They're liars. Who are these superhuman robots that never
procrastinate? Uh, yeah, I think 5% of people are liars. Um, 42% of
adults report procrastinating regularly. Uh, and then 25% of adults
report being chronic procrastinators, which is essentially means that
you are just literally procrastinating everything all the time, right?
anything you try to do you end up procrastinating which that is that's
a shocking amount 25% of people. So this is a huge problem. This is
like this is a massive affliction that you know gets to us all. Um so
some of the things that we're going to go through procrastination as a
topic is really interesting because it it is it is such a common human
occurrence that there is thought on it going back 2500 years.
</p>

<p>
So, we went back 200 years and we're going to cover basically the
entire corpus of human thought and approach towards procrastination uh
since the beginning of civilization. And it's actually kind of
surprising because a lot of things that we take to be true or a lot of
our assumptions of what procrastination is are relatively
modern. They're not they're they're pretty recent and and and you know
people in the ancient world or people in medieval times wouldn't
necessarily agree with us and how we approach uh the topic of
procrastination.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately we're going to get to the bottom of what is
procrastination. What like fundamentally like what is happening in
your brain? What is happening psychologically when you're
procrastinating something? When you're not doing the thing you know
you should be doing uh and why does it happen? Why is it even
possible? Right? like if I know something is good for me, like why is
it possible that I can choose not to do that? That that like kind of
doesn't make sense in a in a certain philosophical way.
</p>

<p>
Of course, we're going to cover all the latest research on
procrastination. We're actually going to cover the entire history of
research on procrastination. Uh and because a lot of it got it wrong
and a lot of the conventional wisdom and typical self-help advice
today is based on that old research that got it wrong. And the new
research is says some things quite different than uh maybe what you're
expecting. And of course, we are going to go through at least a dozen
different tactics and strategies that the listener can implement uh to
help lessen procrastination in their lives. Uh I think if there's one
thing that I've learned preparing for this episode, Drew, is that I
don't think procrastination's ever something that we just like
completely get rid of.
</p>

<p>
I think that it is it just seems to be kind of a side effect or a cost
of being humans who have agency and have complex brains. Um we'll get
more into that, but I do think it <i>is incumbent on all of us</i> to do
all the things that we can to lessen or mitigate the procrastination
in our lives. And I do think that is very much attainable for most
people uh relatively quickly.
</p>

<p>
So before we get into it, anything you want to add, Drew? Um, what are
you most excited for? I mean, this what are you procrastinating? Oh,
god. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. This is a very common, very
pervasive problem. And um, we all struggle with it. And I think
there's just there's a tragedy kind of a tragic side to it as well cuz
you know what what else is there to do but do the things you want to
do in life, right? And then we put those things those very things
off.
</p>

<p>
So, I think a lot of people are going to find a there's just going to
be a big nodfest going on while you're listening to this. And um yeah,
I'm excited to get into it because it's something I struggle with
quite a bit. I don't know if I'm a chronic procrastinator, but there's
chronic strains of procrastination that I sometimes run into for
sure. Sure. Um I have a lot of experience with this just being an
author, a self-employed person um for my entire career. So, we'll
we'll get into that.
</p>

<p>
And you mentioned something which is like kind of the tragedy of it is
that what we we'll actually discover later on the episode is that the
proportion of procrastination is actually uh directly correlated to
how important we see a task being in our lives. So it's like
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
the more important the task is the more likely we are to procrastinate
it
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
which is so screwed up right like like that's so unfair. Why does that
happen? Yeah.
</p>

<p>
We'll dig into why that is but yeah it's fascinating. But before we
dive in, uh there's going to be a lot of information in this
podcast. And between me and you and our research team, I think we went
through like what 13 14 books and 100 research articles. So to help
everyone get through this, we've put together a companion PDF
guide. It's 65 pages, includes a full summary of the show, all of our
citations and references, has book recommendations, and it includes
some practical takeaways and lessons as well. So, if you're listening
to this, you can get the PDF guide for free by going to
solvedodcast.com/procrastination. That's
solvedodcast.com/procrastination. The link is also in the description
if you want to get through there. All right, let's get started.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf33e82c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf33e82c">What exactly is procrastination?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf33e82c">
<p>
Okay, so let's start off with uh a couple definitions first because it
it I was actually surprised how hard it was to actually pin down a
technical definition of procrastination. And even the one that I
chose, as we'll see, there's a little bit of wiggle room with it. So,
there's a researcher named Pier Steel in up in Canada. He did a big
meta analysis in 2007, which is basically what a meta analysis is is
for listeners is that it's when a researcher takes all of the the
relevant studies or data and then kind of like finds a way to combine
them into like a super study. So this guy still did this in 2007 and
he crafted this definition of procrastination based on all the
research at the time which is this
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
procrastination is the act of unnecessarily delaying something despite
knowing that there could be negative consequences for doing
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
so and when I look at this I kind of like break it down into three
factors.
</p>

<p>
So the first factor is an <i>unnecessary delay</i>, right? I think this is
important because prioritization is not procrastination. Like if my
plan is to uh write a a script this morning but uh then my wife gets
in a car accident and I have to go to the hospital like that's not
procrastination because something more important has now
interfered. It's only when the delay is completely unnecessary uh and
fabricated.
</p>

<p>
Um the second one is that there are <i>negative consequences</i>. So a lot
of times when you delay something there actually are not negative
consequences. There are plenty of things that you can delay and
there's actually nothing that immediately there's no immediate
feedback that makes you feel bad for that. I think this is why so many
people procrastinate uh things like working out or eating well because
the that feedback loop is so insanely long. You know it's like 10 20
30 years before you actually experience the repercussion for that
decision. uh it's very easy to convince yourself that like there is no
downside to eating the pizza tonight and uh sitting on the couch for
another day.
</p>

<p>
Uh and then finally the third factor is <i>despite knowing</i> and this is
where it gets tricky.
</p>

<p>
Like I actually found this whole definition very interesting because
all three of these factors are <i>ultimately subjective</i>. Like who says
a delay is unnecessary? Who's to decide what's necessary and what's
not necessary, right? Who's to say what a negative consequence is?
Like you say potato, I say potato. And who says that you're aware or
that you know?
</p>

<p>
My personal experience is that most of my procrastination is I'm I'm
usually bullshitting myself on all three of these factors. I've
convinced myself that there is no negative consequence that's going to
happen or the negative consequence is very minor. It's not a big
deal. I've convinced myself that the delay is actually extremely
necessary. Like when else am I going to be able to watch this Netflix
show if if not for right now?  And and then of course I myself of
saying that like I'm aware I know that this is going to cause a
negative. It's like well who knows, right? Like maybe you know a book
will write itself, right? It happens all the time.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I definitely ran into this too when talking with people about
this, you know, kind of prepping with this and just talking with
people around my life too. I definitely ran into this. They're like,
"Well, is it so bad that you put this off?  is I there was a lot of
that that goes into it.
</p>

<p>
So yeah, it's very subjective. It's Yeah. And it it is there's a whole
question around this of of awareness and knowledge uh which is
actually very much well we we'll get into that. We're getting a little
bit ahead of myself. So the other thing that kind of surprised me and
I guess well I I guess it makes sense is that there there is a
cultural element to this um that I think is worth discussing at least
just for a few minutes especially because I know the the audience for
this podcast is extremely international.
</p>

<p>
So it turns out that procrastination is to a certain extent
<i>culturally defined or culturally relative</i>. There are some cultures
where showing up late it's not a huge deal. Turning something in late
is not really judged or viewed as as something negative. Um, it
actually reminded me, so I I lived in Brazil for a few years. My wife
is Brazilian and and it's one of the things that drove me crazy as an
American down there is that if you if you ever do a business meeting
with a Brazilian, um, first of all, they show up like 20 minutes
late. Uh, then they spend the first 20 minutes like talking about
their weekend and uh, telling you about like their kids soccer game
and uh, you know, asking you what kind of beer you like. And uh and
then it's like not until like minute 45 that you actually get to the
thing that you're supposed to be talking about. And what's interesting
down there is that if you ever like cut try to cut that time down,
they see it as as impolite and rude. Like they see you as doing
something wrong.
</p>

<p>
Um whereas coming from American culture where I'm like, "Dude, I was
here at 10:00 a.m. It's 10:45. We still haven't even like talked about
the the business thing." I see it as rude that they're like wasting my
time. So this concept of time and punctuality uh is very culturally
dependent.
</p>

<p>
And what I found interesting there there's a a social psychologist
from from the Netherlands named Gear Hof who did a bunch of work on
just like cultural factors. He I think he called it I think it's
called <i>cultural dimensions</i> theory or something like that. And um he
talked about how certain cultures have different orientations towards
time and they have different understandings of like what is something
that's done on time or not. Um, so some cultures very much
prioritize.
</p>

<p>
So like western cultures or like Anglo-Saxon cultures very much
prioritize uh like following the clock. Like if I say we're going to
do a thing at 11:30 and you show up at 11:35 to me, you've now delayed
things unnecessarily. It's causing negative consequences. So on and so
on. It's procrastination. Some cultures, if you say 11:30 and they
show up at 11:40, as long as they show up in a way that's like feels
justified or is like emotionally consistent uh with the people around
them, it's not seen as being late, you know?
</p>

<p>
It's like, oh well, yeah, we were going to be here 15 minutes ago, but
like uh I was hanging out with my my my brother and my cousin, and we
were having a great conversation. Um and so it just took longer. And
like that's seen as a completely justified response.
</p>

<p>
And so it's interesting that I guess coming back to the subjectivity
of procrastination, some cultures see it very strictly in terms of
tasks getting completed on time and some cultures see it more in terms
of like emotions and relationships. like in Brazil, if I don't sit
there and kind of chitchat for 20 minutes, um that is seen as some
sort of productive failure because I'm not doing the work to maintain
the relationship with that person. Okay. Yeah. Um anyway, it's just
very interesting. We're not going to spend a ton of time on this, but
I like I said, I'm bringing it up simply because we do have a big
international audience.
</p>

<p>
There are going to be people listening to this in Latin America and
the Middle East and the Mediterranean and some of these places that
are not so rigid with the clock itself. They're more kind of
emotional, social and emotionally based. Um, and it's just worth
considering. And I think it it really just comes back to I think
probably a more effective way to just frame this entire discussion is
why do we consistently fail at doing the things we wish we could do,
right? Like we have things that we know are good for us and we want to
do them yet we don't do them.

<div id="outline-container-org2e0c89b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2e0c89b">Plato's Thoughts on Procrastination</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2e0c89b">
<p>
Let's go back. I think the best way I decided the best way to do this
is to just go start at the beginning. So the first recorded discussion
of procrastination and what what it is and why it happens does start
with Plato. He has a few dialogues that get into it. The first one is
uh called <i>Protagoras</i>. There's a quote from Socrates in there. He says,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Surely no one goes willingly towards the bad or what he believes to
be bad. Neither is it in human nature, so it seems to want to go
toward what one believes to be bad instead of the good."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Plato puts forth like a really interesting argument. He kind of argues
that procrastination like doesn't actually exist. That like if you're
not doing the thing, it's because deep down you actually don't think
it's worth doing. That if you thought it was worth doing, then you
would just go do it.
</p>

<p>
And it's kind of interesting that the earliest take ever on
procrastination is like super spicy like that. I wouldn't expect
that. I would expect something like, you know, uh uh I don't know,
start small or um you know, like give yourself a little reward, a
piece of candy if you like if you do something that that you've been
putting off. And it's like Plato's like no, no, it's it's impossible
to do something that you don't think is the best thing to do, which I
think just intu like our gut intuition, everybody's gut
intuition.
</p>

<p>
It's just like that that doesn't feel true. Does that feel true to
you? Absolutely not. No. the definition you brought up earlier and
we'll get into that a little more too, but despite knowing part,
right? I just I feel like anybody you talk to, they've probably got at
least a handful of things in their life that like they know are good
for them and they don't do it. Exactly. So Plato's full of No, that's
So, okay, I'm I'm being I'm being facetious.
</p>

<p>
The interesting thing about Plato is so almost all of his work is
written in the forms of dialogues and those dialogues revolve around
it's usually Socrates having a a debate a philosophical debate uh with
some other prominent person and in most of the dialogue Socrates just
kind of like clowns the the person and there there there's a lot of
ambiguity around Plato's work for a couple reasons. One is it's
sometimes unclear because Socrates was a real person and Plato was uh
somebody who like followed and learned from Socrates. So, especially
in in the early dialogues, it is hard to differentiate between what
Socrates thought and what and Plato is just reporting what he thought
versus like what Plato actually thinks and he's just putting his words
into Socrates's mouth.
</p>

<p>
So there's a lot of ambiguity around that and Socrates had a
reputation for being a bit of a troll. The second piece of ambiguity
is that sometimes Plato would just create a dialogue to just kind of
raise points and play with those ideas and because they it was a
conversation between uh two historical figures, it's sometimes unclear
if he actually believes what he's writing.
</p>

<p>
So later on, in <i>"The Republic"</i> which was actually uh seems to be
very clearly Plato's thoughts and ideas um he kind of backtracked a
little bit and and the republic is the first place that you see this
idea of what he called the tripartite soul and it's he basically says
that the the mind is divided up into three different parts and it and
it's actually pretty incredible because this idea still persists today
like you still see it all over psychology and philosophy today. So the
three parts of the mind is he called the the rational, the spirit and
the appetitive.
</p>

<p>
One way to think about that is that there's like the animalistic self,
the part of you that has hunger and impulses and cravings. There's the
emotional part of yourself. That's the spirit, right? It's the
anger. It's the love. It's the passion. It's the joy. It's the
sadness. And then you have the rational, which is like the calculating
and um the the logic and all that stuff.
</p>

<p>
Plato's argument is that he used the metaphor of a chariot which is
that the rational part of yourself is like the driver in a chariot and
he has two horses in front of him. One horse is the animalistic
appetitive part of yourself. The other one is the spirit-emotional
part of yourself and it is your job to guide those horses in the right
direction. But they're wild horses. And so sometimes they're going to
buck and they're going to run and they're going to go try to go in
different directions and it's going to be chaotic, right?
</p>

<p>
And in the Republic, Plato said that it is essentially what
procrastination is or back then they called it a basically this
experience of not doing the thing that you know you should do is when
essentially your horses don't go where you want them to go. It's like,
"Hey, we should go to the gym." And the horses just start going
towards the fridge for another piece of cold pizza. And you're like,
"Wait, no." And then next thing you know, you're there.
</p>

<p>
And so I feel like that is a little bit more relatable and a little
bit more understandable. But I think that the takeaway from Plato is
that he ultimately saw Acrasia or procrastination as a knowledge
problem. It was your problem isn't that you don't have willpower. The
problem isn't that you don't have discipline. The problem is that you
just aren't aware enough of the repercussions of your choices. He kind
of puts forth this argument that like if people were just more
knowledgeable and educated on what their choices were causing in their
life, they wouldn't make those choices.
</p>

<p>
And I personally think this is a very idealistic view. I think it's it
feels nice. I mean, there's something to it clearly like knowledge
certainly does help probably at the margins, but I also just think
it's it's I don't know. It's too like roses and rainbows. It doesn't
match my personal experience.
</p>

<p>
Uh and I don't think it matches most of the people that I know who
really struggle with procrastination and and not doing the right
thing. Um but it is it's a nice it feels good to believe. It feels
good to believe that like oh if I just understood what I was doing
when I was going back to the fridge instead of the gym then I wouldn't
do it so much. And you actually like you still see this a lot. It's
funny. I'm going to I'm not going to name names, but um I was on
social media the other day, and I see this stuff all the time.
</p>

<p>
So, this is a very prominent person in our space posted this. They
said,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Your entire life will change when you realize that you have to
sacrifice short-term freedom in order to earn long-term
freedom. Instant gratification will kill your dreams."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ed has over a quarter of a million views and 7,000 likes, right? No
Sherlock. Right. Right. Like everybody knows that. We all know the
information. We all know that. Like it it's not you're not moving the
needle by telling us that. But I think there is a part of ourselves, a
very idealistic part of ourselves that just feels like if we were
reminded of that, then it wouldn't be so hard. That it would be a
little bit easier to get up early in the morning and, you know, put on
your workout shoes and, you know, start with the hardest task of your
day.
</p>

<p>
And you know all those things that we wish we could do. So that's kind
of the first school of thought. We're going to return to it quite a
bit. It it like most of Plato's ideas, they never really go away. It's
interesting. We actually, you and I talked to pretty much the most
prominent researcher on procrastination in the world, Fuchsia
Sarra. And even talking to her, she brought this up multiple
times. This never really disappears, but it starts it starts with
Plato.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org936a420" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org936a420">The Buddhist &amp; Confucian Views on Procrastination</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org936a420">
<p>
Yeah. The second school of thought I want to bring up. So around the
same time, the Buddha was doing his thing and uh Buddhism has an
interesting kind of spin-off of the the Platonic idea that that I
think is worth talking about just briefly simply because I think when
towards the end of end of the episode when we talk about interventions
and tactics and strategies, there is a little bit of the Buddhist
approach that I think makes sense.
</p>

<p>
So Buddhism saw procrastination as <i>ignorance of oneself</i>. You know,
Plato saw it as like an ignorance of the consequences of your
action. The Buddha saw it as an ignorance of your own cravings and
desires, not understanding what your own motivations were, which I
think is a really interesting twist. And I actually think there's
probably a lot more value in the Buddhist approach.
</p>

<p>
Like I just know from my own life, you know, I like as you know, I
went through this huge weight loss journey over many years. And a big
component of that was like really understanding where my food cravings
were coming from. What was causing my distractions when I couldn't
focus or or or get any work done. And sure enough, usually there's
like some emotion underneath the surface that's like driving
things. And becoming aware of that or mindful of that and then um
learning how to how to deal or negotiate with that emotion is super
useful.
</p>

<p>
Uh so I thought like the Buddhist twist on the ignorance as as on the
procrastination as a knowledge issue. Um I actually think there's it
carries some water.
</p>

<p>
Sticking with Eastern philosophy, just want to touch really quick on
Confucianism. Um from I'm not I'm by no means an expert on
Confucianism, but uh by the little bit of research I did, it didn't
seem like there was a whole lot directly written about it. But the
interesting thing about Confucianism is that there is so much emphasis
put on accountability and social pressure. Um everything in
Confucianism is kind of written in such a way of like you have to do
the right thing to honor your family, your society, your your country,
your emperor, whatever. There's a nugget in there as well that's
actually really important and useful that we will come back to much
later. But that social pressure and accountability is like a legit
thing.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org9dc50cf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9dc50cf">Aristotle's Take on Procrastination</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9dc50cf">
<p>
Um, this finally brings us to Aristotle. So, Aristotle in the
Nikomachian ethics wrote quite a bit about <i>akrasia or
procrastination</i>. He wrote quite a bit about why people don't do the
things that they they should be doing. And I have to say, dude, like
as somebody who has studied the psychology around this for a decade,
going back and reading Aristotle's take, I'm like, "Oh, he nailed it."
Like the dude just nailed it over 2,000 years ago. Yeah. Like 2,300
years ago, he's just like in one chapter just like, "Here's why we
don't do the things that we know we should do."

<p>
So, Aristotle essentially, here's like the super condensed version of
what he says. Aristotle essentially saw procrastination as a skill
issue. He said,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Like any other skill, we all are born terrible at it."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Uh, and then as we grow older, we develop and practice and and
habituate ourselves to it. And anybody can learn to do it. Anybody can
practice it. Anybody can develop the skill or discipline. And like any
skill or discipline, some people are naturally extremely gifted at it
and some people are naturally not gifted at it. Right?
</p>

<p>
What's also interesting about this view is that he kind of puts his
middle finger up the Play-Doh. He's just like, "Dude, we all don't do
the things we know we should do." Like, we all know we should do
certain things and we just fail to do them. Look around
you. Yeah. Seriously, like it it's like wake up, man.
</p>

<p>
But what I like about Aristotle as well is that it's <i>there was no
moral judgment or shame attached to it</i>. This is actually what's super
unique and interesting and like way ahead of his time. With Plato, it
was there was a little bit of like, well, they're not doing the right
thing just cuz they're they're ignorant. They're uneducated. They're
not as privileged as you and I are, right? They're not as enlightened
as us.
</p>

<p>
You know, in the Buddhist view, there's if you're not doing the right
thing, like you got to get right with yourself, dude. Like, you know,
sit on a mat and meditate for a few years and and and like figure out
what the hell's going on in your head. You know, the Confucious
system, it's like you're dishonoring your family and you're you're
screwing up society. Like, get your together. Aristotle's like, "Hey,
man, we all struggle with this. This is a journey for all of us and
it's something that any of us can get better at. Any of us can
practice it. We can develop the right habits, we can develop the right
skills and you can and you can improve upon it.
</p>

<p>
And so I think the first takeaway around all of this is that
ultimately there are like there's a little bit of truth in everything
that each of those schools of thought said there, you know, some of it
is knowledge of the repercussions that are going to happen if you, I
don't know, stay up till 4:00 a.m. on a Tuesday night. Some of it is
understanding your own internal awareness and emotions and you know
what's motivating you, what's driving you. Some of it is finding good
accountability systems and social pressure to like nudge you in the
right direction. But ultimately, this is a skill issue. It's something
that you can learn. It's something you can get better at and it's
something that you have to to try to get better at.
</p>

<p>
So, I'm curious, Drew, have you seen your procrastination as a <i>skill
issue</i>? Uh, because I certainly haven't most of my life. I'm curious
what your experience was. No, I think there is just a lot of that
self-judgment that goes into it and I've always thought, yeah, if I
just knew a little bit more, had the the right information at the
right time, then I would be a better person, not so, you know, morally
corrupt. Yeah. uh and and bankrupt in my ways.
</p>

<p>
But um yeah, it's it's interesting that each one of these kind of
schools of thought took one angle at it and it's like, yeah, you got
that right, but you got this completely wrong. Yeah. And I I feel that
within myself even too today. So, yeah, definitely. I think I started
seeing it as a skill issue relatively late in my life. I would say
like well into adulthood. Like I have vague I have vague memories in
my 20s of like starting my first business and just being like
incredibly upset at myself for playing too many video games or not
being able to finish a work task in the amount of time that I allotted
for myself. Like just really chastising myself and beating myself up
over it. Uh and <i>I feel like that's the default for most people</i>.
</p>

<p>
Like there is a shame and there's a moral judgment. And what I found
super fascinating and surprising is that that moral judgment is is for
the most part didn't exist in the ancient world. You know, Aristotle
saw saw uh accasia or or doing the right action. He saw he had a whole
<i>ethical system around virtue</i>, right?
</p>

<p>
The virtues were like the right way to live. But Aristotle was very
aware that like nobody is virtuous all the time. The virtues are never
achieved. They're they're just something that you work towards and you
get better at over time and everybody's going to screw it
up. Everybody's going to fail to a certain extent. And so the only
thing you can do is <i>just try to fail less</i>.
</p>

<p>
And if you look at the Stoics, there's there's a very <i>similar vein
there</i>, right? It's like you should try to be virtuous. The the Stoics
were a little bit more platonic in that they saw it as more of a a
lack like a knowledge problem, but it it's still the same attitude of
like nobody's virtuous all the time. Nobody gets it right all the
time. Just get up each day and try to do your best and try not to
dwell on on your failures and and things like that.
</p>

<p>
And it's it's so fascinating like going back and looking at those
takes because that doesn't feel like anything I heard growing
up. Yeah. Right. I heard that you are you are a a immoral piece of
who's irresponsible and is failing yourself and failing your future
and failing your family and like it it is there's so much moral
judgment especially I guess in western culture but I think eastern
culture as well there's so much moral judgment wrapped up in your
ability to be disciplined you know. Like I think about people who are
obese or overweight like one of the huge judgments against them it's
not about the unhealthy illness. It's about the apparent lack of
discipline, right?
</p>

<p>
Like I've been around people who have said really mean things about
overweight people. And <i>it's never about the weight</i>. It's about the
like why can't they control themselves? Why can't they like keep food
out of their mouth? How could you let yourself go to that extent?
</p>


<p>
Yeah. Right. Yeah. And it and we have similar judgments like if
somebody loses their job or if somebody doesn't make a lot of
money. Um it it's there's like a moral judgment. It's and we just we
joked about it earlier, right? It's like if I showed up an hour late
for this shoot, you would judge me. Yes. Yes, I would. Yes, you
would. So, it's interesting that that didn't always exist like
that. That is it started somewhere along the line. And uh drum
roll. Do you want to guess where it started? I have a good idea. Why
don't you go ahead? I'll give you one. It starts with a Chris and it
ends with aity. Yeah. Yeah. <i>One of the seven deadly sins</i>, right?
</p>

<p>
Sloth. Sloth.
</p>

<p>
Exactly. Exactly.
