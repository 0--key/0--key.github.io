As the TDD approach became a standard option in web development it
is time to wrap all code you're studied already in this modern
envelop. It is <code>not just modern quirk</code>, it mainly used to enhance
your general coding skills by bundling it together with instant code
quality testing, simplify software development process as a whole
and furthermore grant you ability to go further in career.
</p>

<p>
Next would be as a <b>literate code unveiled TDD approach</b> for direct
execution on your host. On a flip side the code might serve to you
as a gauge and start point, or even to encourage you in your journey
across realm of knowledge. Exactly to rectify your personal Python
skill all code samples should be run in a slick manner, hence it all
possible to modify, improve or rearrange on your own taste.

For experienced users I might suggest to fork this project on <a href="https://github.com/0--key/0--key.github.io">Github</a>

Any science is an experience which forged and enveloped in some
skill. Data science by its nature built on data. Read-only access is
an initial proves possession over some particular data. There are
several much precise tools to compose quires and get much
informative data out of array. It's the second flow on data
processing functions list. The third one might be data integrity
checking strategy on duty to prevent any data corruption and lost.
And as a final stage in deriving data on the preparation table
scrutiny.

<p>
There are infinite number of wrong approaches and the best path to
achieve some skill is to learn it by doing. For example it's
completely impossible to play basketball with no ideas about the
rules of this dexterity demonstration. As another premise of
apprenticeship it might be noticed about Ancient Greek samples of
great thinkers, who ponder about most of our modern science in the
same way. All they was scholars and learn all life long.
