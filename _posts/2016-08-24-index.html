<p>
As the TDD approach became a standard option in web development it
is time to wrap all code you're studied already in this modern
envelop. It is <code>not just modern quirk</code>, it mainly used to enhance
your general coding skills by bundling it together with instant code
quality testing, simplify software development process as a whole
and furthermore grant you ability to go further in career.
</p>

<p>
Next would be as a <b>literate code unveiled TDD approach</b> for direct
execution on your host. On a flip side the code might serve to you
as a gauge and start point, or even to encourage you in your journey
across realm of knowledge. Exactly to rectify your personal Python
skill all code samples should be run in a slick manner, hence it all
possible to modify, improve or rearrange on your own taste.
</p>

<p>
For experienced users I might suggest to fork this project on <a href="https://github.com/0--key/0--key.github.io">Github</a>
and evaluate it for your personal usage. In any case feel free to
contribute to it.

<blockquote>
<p>
Any science is an experience which forged and enveloped in some
skill. Data science by its nature built on data.
</p>

<p>
There are several levels of data acquisition:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Read-only access is an initial proves possession over some
particular data.</li>
<li>There are several much precise tools to compose quires and get
much informative data out of array. It's the second flow on data
processing functions list.</li>
<li>The third one might be data integrity checking strategy on duty to
prevent any data corruption and lost.</li>
<li>And as a final stage in data cooking it might be data visualisation.</li>

<p>
There are infinite number of wrong approaches and the best path to
achieve some skill is to learn it by doing. For example it's
completely impossible to play basketball with no ideas about the
rules of this dexterity demonstration. As another premise of
apprenticeship it might be noticed about Ancient Greek samples of
great thinkers, who ponder about most of our modern science in the
same way. All they was scholars and learn all life long.

<p>
Of cause learning by doing is a final stage in human creativity. It
requires a lot of passion, huge amount of time and hardships happen
certainly. And it is a peculiar time machine. There is one way
further, and a lot of noways.

<p>
In my humble opinion the best way to learn programming language lies
in reading source code of working code samples. Code and its output
are crucially dense (habitually awkward) text. Read and run it by
yourself. It's comprehensive and unique thus useful for education.
If you wish to unleash your brain feel free to modify or even
improve my code. In any case good luck, keep clear and detect calamity
in their seeds.
