<blockquote>
<p>
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a
computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to
human beings what we want a computer to do.
</p>

<p>
The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an
essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of
style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of
variables carefully and explains what each variable means. He or
she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its
concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human
understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that
reinforce each other.

Believe it or not, any course in computer programming covers <i>all</i>
the tools strictly necessary to solve any problem that can be solved
with a computer. A very famous computer scientist named Alan Turing
conjectured, and it is now widely accepted, that any problem
solvable with computers requires only the basic statements that all
computer programming languages include: decision statements (e.g. ,
if), looping statements (e.g. , for and while) and the ability to
store and retrieve data. Since you already know about these, you may
wonder what else there is to learn. That's a good question.

If you think of computer programming as a process similar to
constructing a building, right now you have the knowledge equivalent
to how to use a few tools such as a hammer, screwdriver, saw, and
drill. Those might be all the tools necessary to build a house, but
that does not mean you can build yourself a habitable home, let
alone one that meets modern building codes. That's not to say that
you can't do some useful things. You are probably capable of
building benches or birdhouses, you're just not yet ready for the
challenges that come with a larger project. In programming, just as
in house construction, tackling bigger projects requires additional
knowledge, techniques, and skills.
