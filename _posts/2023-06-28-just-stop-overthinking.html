99% of the harm is caused in your head, by you and your thoughts. 1%
of the harm is caused by reality, what actually happens and the
outcome. Most of the time, the problem isn't the problem. The way you
think about the problem is.

Don't think you deserve that opportunity? Apply for it anyways. Don't

they'll reply to your email? <b>Send it anyways.</b> Never overthink
yourself into <b>self-rejection.</b>

The truth is, most problems aren't solved with more thinking, they're
solved with less. You'll find most of the answers you're looking for
in silence, in time band with a clear mind. If you can't solve a
problem, <i>stop trying to</i>. Sometimes doing nothing can do more for
you, than you're might expect.

<h3 id="orgceef96a">An important question</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgceef96a">
<p>
When you start criticizing yourself for past mistakes, or seeing
disaster around every corner, ask yourself:
</p>

<p>
<code>Is there anything I can do right now to change the past or to
positively influence the future?</code>
</p>

<p>
If the answer is <i>Yes</i>, do it take action. If the answer is <i>No</i>, be
at peace let it go. You have to take action or let it go, everything
else is self-harm.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5f648be" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5f648be">The power of now</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5f648be">
<p>
You're not going to overthink your way to a better future. You're not
going to overthink your way to a better past. All you have is <b>NOW.</b>
And what you do with <b>NOW</b> can make right of your past and make good
of your future. Make peace with yesterday, let go of tomorrow, grab
hold of now.

<h3 id="orga66e86d">Fact check your own thoughts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga66e86d">
<p>
Your thoughts will create scenarios in your mind that reflect your
insecurities, fears, and worries. So it's important to always
fact-check your thoughts before accepting them because, in highly
emotional situations, your thoughts will tell you stories that aren't
true.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fact-check yourself.</b>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc7d6a99" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc7d6a99">Acceptance is peace</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc7d6a99">
<p>
No amount of anxiety will change your future, no amount of regret will
change your past.
</p>

<p>
<i>Peace is found in acceptance:</i>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Accept imperfection;</li>
<li>Accept uncertainty;</li>
<li>Accept the uncontrollable.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You don't have to understand, tolerate or even forget something, but
if you want peace, you must accept it.

<p>
You can go to the gym, eat healthy, do yoga, drink water and take
vitamins, but if you don't directly confront the negativity in your
thoughts, you will never truly be 'healthy'. Our health isn't measured
on scales, by the size of our muscules or by the width of our
waist. True health is measured by the quality of our thougts and the
peacefulness of our minds. Health starts in your mind.
