I'm a voracious reader and avid knowledge gatherer as long as I can
remember myself. Initially it was just fun, a bit later I commenced a
conscious approach to learning and found an urge necessity for
meta-learning: skill allowing to study any subject much effective.
</p>

<p>
After acquisition of these skills, when I've <a href="http://bit.ly/2nPfOXR">learnt how to learn</a>,
naturally appeared the next challenge:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What should I know to be healthy, wealthy and wise?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Soon it became clear to me <code>I should know everything</code> for that and it
is just impossible due to <code>infinite amount of knowledge</code>. So I need
to find a trade off, a some hack which allows me <code>to be happy enough</code>
to live and prosper. And I choose to study <code>Computer Science</code> that by
definition ought to amplify my ability to sift, order and consume
information. Furthermore these skills will liverage my capability to
acquire the knowledge much faster.
</p>

<p>
Further, pondering in this direction pointed me out <code>Python</code> as the
main tool to cope with a plethora of <b>Data</b>, <code>Emacs</code> as the handy
tool to cope with <code>Python</code>, <code>Bash</code>, myself and computer in the same
time. A mammoth task was to find a cue to myself, elaborate the right
system in learning, other required only time and patience.
</p>

<p>
Several years I've spent studying these mighty tools, from time to
time practicing in applied areas, making pauses for contemplation,
and now I'm proud that I'm in charge to solve most of feasible tasks.

Synergy &rarr; the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations,
substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than
the sum of their separate effects:

A synergy among the team is not just only a sum of knowledge, our
goal is to obtain its product literally:

<li>In other words the desired aim should be a <i>knowledge
multiplication</i>: sustainable state of continuous intellectual
advancements for each collaborator in particular.</li>
<li>A team of professionals with mostly contiguous skills.</li>
<li>Right now for professional growth I'm crucially need in <i>knowledge
exchange</i>: who knows something fascinating and would share it with
me, please?</li>

contrarian, a snap judgment about real power of machines, owing to
my innate curiosity and perseverance, I've brooded about lack of
skills that restrained, damp down the rush around these points, To
avert the brain withering, to enshrine the versatile skills in one
place, to choose an eligible approach to disclose the topic in a
much attractive and explicit manner, austerely overview the
customary of writing books about programming languages it might be
sufficient to found its basement, suppose it is at whole a slightly
primitive novel in English which thoroughly endeavor to shed the
light on another language niceties.

<p>
Emerging unit testing in the early 2000 produced a sismic shift in
software development, but still be totally ignored by the writers.
</p>

<p>
In these circumstances the inset test suites should serve a
lucrative role in learning: they just vividly illustrate the core
features in a functional dissection, sufficiently aleviate a
headache and pain, facilitating fast and easy comprehension what is
all this stuff purpose.
</p>

<p>
In any case the author is entangled among only two languages: the
programming one and a straight English.
</p>

<p>
The core idea is to grant to the reader chance to swoop up the gist
from the text.
</p>

<p>
Let's take an attempt to judge that approach to a nicetiy.
