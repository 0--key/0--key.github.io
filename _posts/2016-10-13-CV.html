I'm an avid knowledge gatherer as long as I can remember myself. The
acts speak much louder than words, thus, this is the very gist out
of my professional skills: <a href="http://bit.ly/2nPfOXR">Leaning to Learn</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2nSSGJQ">Introduction to Data
Science</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1lk9C7p">Model Thinking</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2nP3uqx">Ovivo</a>, Pythonanywhere, 0&#x2013;key, <a href="http://bit.ly/211LI1k">oDesk</a>,
FastFresh, Py-Org-Cookbook, Perceptron in OOP Python3, Python Design
Patterns Catalogue, StackOverflow.

In 2017 I've begun to dissect an Artificial Intelligent approach for
data classification, Elisp, NumPy, SciPy, GNU Octave and enrolled
into <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/home">Neural Networks for Machine Learning</a>.

Synergy &rarr; the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations,
substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than
the sum of their separate effects:
</p>

<p>
\(\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{team}\sum_{k=1}^{skill}\Rightarrow\prod_{n=1}^{team}\sum_{k=1}^{skill}\)

<li>A team catalyst, accelerator and propeller. Who next will fall in

A synergy among the team is not just only a sum of knowledge, our
goal is to obtain its product literally:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
\(\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{team}\sum_{k=1}^{skill}\to\prod_{n=1}^{team}\sum_{k=1}^{skill}\)
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>In other words the desired aim should be a <i>knowledge
multiplication</i>: sustainable state of continuous intellectual
advancements for each collaborator in particular.</li>
<li>A team of professionals with mostly contiguous skills.</li>
<li>Right now for professional growth I'm crucially need in <i>knowledge
exchange</i>: who knows something fascinating and would share it with
me, please?</li>

contrarian, a snap judgment about real power of machines, owing to
my innate curiosity and perseverance, I've brooded about lack of
skills that restrained, damp down the rush around these points, To
avert the brain withering, to enshrine the versatile skills in one
place, to choose an eligible approach to disclose the topic in a
much attractive and explicit manner, austerely overview the
customary of writing books about programming languages it might be
sufficient to found its basement, suppose it is at whole a slightly
primitive novel in English which thoroughly endeavor to shed the
light on another language niceties.

<p>
Emerging unit testing in the early 2000 produced a sismic shift in
software development, but still be totally ignored by the writers.

<p>
In these circumstances the inset test suites should serve a
lucrative role in learning: they just vividly illustrate the core
features in a functional dissection, sufficiently aleviate a
headache and pain, facilitating fast and easy comprehension what is
all this stuff purpose.
</p>

<p>
In any case the author is entangled among only two languages: the
programming one and a straight English.
</p>

<p>
The core idea is to grant to the reader chance to swoop up the gist
from the text.
</p>

<p>
Let's take an attempt to judge that approach to a nicetiy.
