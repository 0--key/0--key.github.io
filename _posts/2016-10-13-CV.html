Innate fathomless curiousity made me a voracious reader and avid
knowledge gatherer as I can remember myself. Initially it was just a
knowledge thirst and fun aquiring them, a bit later I commenced a
conscious approach to learning and found an urge necessity for
meta-learning: skill that allows to study any subject much effective.
</p>

<p>
After acquisition of these skill, when I've <a href="http://bit.ly/2nPfOXR">learnt how to learn</a>,
naturally loomed the next challenge:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What should I know to be healthy, wealthy and wise?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Soon it became clear to me <i>I should know everything</i> for that and it
is just impossible due to <i>infinite amount of knowledge</i>. So I need
to find a trade off, a some hack which allows me <i>to be happy enough</i>
to live and prosper. And I choose to study <code>Computer Science</code> that by
definition ought to amplify my ability to sift, put it in order and
consume information. And, as an inevitable catalyser, <a href="http://bit.ly/1lk9C7p">model thinking</a>
was a right tool in the hands. Furthermore these skills will liverage
my capability to acquire the knowledge much faster.
</p>

<p>
Further, pondering in this direction pointed me out <code>Python</code> as the
main tool to cope with a plethora of <b>Data</b>, <code>Emacs</code> as the powerful
enough tool to cope with <code>Python</code>, <code>Bash</code>, computer and me in the
same time. A mammoth task was to find a clue to myself, elaborate the
right system in learning, all that left required only time and
patience.
</p>

<p>
Several years I've spent studying these mighty tools, from time to
time practicing in applied areas, making pauses for contemplation,
and now I'm proud that I've forge another person from myself, and
seems it is very time to help other.

<p>
<b>Python</b> deliberately sliced and diced in <b>Emacs</b> - this dish is for
gourmets and connoisseurs only. More than 30 years experience in
applied programming, more than 10 years of acquaintance with <b>Python</b>
allow to define me on the expert level, and seems like I literally am
a <i>programming adept</i>!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge3ac107">
<p>
I've installed my first Linux distro (it was <b>RHEL4</b> from CD which
I've serendiptiously bought on the flea market) in 2007. And it was
acute and palpable sensation from obtaining a freedom from proprietary
OS. Later were <b>Ubuntu</b> and <b>Debian</b> in the different shapes,
<b>CentOS</b>, <b>AltLinux</b>, <b>Gentoo</b>, <b>DamnSmallLinux</b>, <b>Fedora</b>,
<b>PuppyLinux</b> and even <code>i386</code> <b>Porteus</b> as a portable version of my
favorite OS on a 512M USB-stick.
</p>

<p>
Naturally it was easy to me to switch on the <code>cloud infrastructure</code>
provided by Amazon Web Services. I've commenced to utilize <b>EC2</b>. And
it was 2011.
</p>

<p>
Now I use <b>Chrome OS</b> on my HP ChromeBook with <b>Debian</b> BullsEye out
from the box.

<div id="outline-container-org37c6f6c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org37c6f6c">Emacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org37c6f6c">
<p>
My first aquaintance was in 2011 and in that moment, due to the lack
of experience, it repelled me by its weirdness and complexity. Later,
than I've got enough adventures with other <code>IDEs</code>, the obvious thought
strikes me:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All these commercial IDEs are use the mouse as a main tool to handle
the code. And the mouse has only two keys on it. On another hand,
<b>Emacs</b> uses a keyboard with at least 104 keys on it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The advantage is obvious: if you are a touch typist (and I was
since 2008) it should be much convenient to use a keyboard to manage
your routine tasks around <b>software development</b>. It has a lot of keys
on it, and your fingers are able to remember these keys to use them
fluently.

<div id="outline-container-orgdece26e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdece26e">Python</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdece26e">
<p>
Initially I met Python code snippet around 2010 and the first
impression was utterly astounding and overly enchanting:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It was like you've finally met a well-known, <i>but occasionally
forgotten by you</i>, version of algorithmic language with additional
faculty to understand you on the fly.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
All in <b>Python</b> was familiar to me, and multiplied by 100 by unnamed
magician who are unfathomably brainy. Yes, the <code>lists</code> is a perfect
idea, and innate methods to handle them are just a deft and obvious
approach to liverage its power. It was a pure rapture there, and now,
more than 10 years later, it becomes clear - it barely is an incessant
rapture.
</p>

<p>
All that I only dreamt on to have in my hands as a <code>flexible</code> and
<code>powerful</code> tool to rule machines, - all this <i>it has already</i> inside.

A synergy among the team is not just only a sum of knowledge, our
goal is to obtain its product literally:

<li>In other words the desired aim should be a <i>knowledge

<li>I see myself in the team of professionals with mostly contiguous

The rule of thumb is: the tough task split requires a handy and mighty
tool in your hand. Mighty tool demandss a lot of time and patience to
become handy.

All tasks are tough enough to be cracked by mighty tool in several
deft gestures; most of the people haven't time to learn any potent
tool and spent all theirs lives tinkering around the shallow tasks in
attempts to resolve them by what they have in theirs disposal - a set
of rude but <i>simple tools</i> with limited functionality but with <i>low

pivotal tool to forge a team synergy, contrarian, a snap judgment
about real power of machines, owing to my innate curiosity and
perseverance, I've brooded about lack of skills that restrained,
damp down the rush around these points, To avert the brain
withering, to enshrine the versatile skills in one place, to choose
an eligible approach to disclose the topic in a much attractive and
explicit manner, austerely overview the customary of writing books
about programming languages it might be sufficient to found its
basement, suppose it is at whole a slightly primitive novel in
English which thoroughly endeavor to shed the light on another
language niceties.
</p>

<p>
Emerging unit testing in the early 2000 produced a sismic shift in
software development, but still be totally ignored by the writers.
</p>

<p>
In these circumstances the inset test suites should serve a
lucrative role in learning: they just vividly illustrate the core
features in a functional dissection, sufficiently aleviate a
headache and pain, facilitating fast and easy comprehension what is
all this stuff purpose.
</p>

<p>
In any case the author is entangled among only two languages: the
programming one and a straight English.
</p>

<p>
The core idea is to grant to the reader chance to swoop up the gist
from the text.
</p>

<p>
Let's take an attempt to judge that approach to a nicetiy.
