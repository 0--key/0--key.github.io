<p>
My innate, boundless curiosity has shaped me into an avid reader and
an insatiable seeker of knowledge. Initially, this was simply an
unconscious thirst, driven by a desire to know everything. However, I
soon realized that it was impossible to cover <i>the infinite</i> expanse
of knowledge. Fifteen years after graduating from university, I
intentionally embarked on a conscious journey to expand my personal
knowledge and discovered the crucial importance of <a href="https://bit.ly/1Kkypx8">Meta-Learning</a> — the
skill that allows one to study any subject <i>more effectively</i> while
<i>still enjoying</i> the process.
</p>

<p>
After acquiring these skills and learning how to learn, a new
challenge naturally emerged:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What should I know to be happy?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, I sought a balance, a hack that would enable me to live a
fulfilling and prosperous life. I decided to study <a href="https://bit.ly/3t5fN8">Data Science</a>, a
field that inherently enhances one's ability to <i>organize and process
information</i>. To further this goal, <a href="http://bit.ly/1lk9C7p">Model Thinking</a> became an
invaluable tool, significantly boosting my capacity for rapid
knowledge acquisition.
</p>

<p>
In this pursuit, <code>Python</code> emerged as my primary tool for handling vast
amounts of data. <code>Emacs</code> proved to be a powerful ally in managing
<code>Python</code>, <code>Bash</code>, my computer, and ultimately, <b>myself</b>, all at
once. Crafting a systematic approach to learning and introspection
became a mammoth task, one that demanded both time and patience.
</p>

<p>
Over several years, I committed myself to mastering these powerful
tools, combining intense periods of focused study with deliberate and
thoughtful practice. Today, I am proud of the profound transformation
I have undergone and feel a compelling drive to share my knowledge and
offer support to others on their own journeys of growth and discovery.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf220ab0">
<blockquote>
<p>
The <b>Meta-Declarative Paradigm of Programming</b> was initially
introduced in September 2024 by Russian-Ukrainian-Irish computer
scientist Anton Sergio Kosinov. It combines natural language for task
description with programming language for test suite definition. This
innovative paradigm enables large language models to write complex
computer programs.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My attention was drawn in early 2024 to an announcement by OpenAI
regarding their capability to write programs. I became deeply engaged
with the <b>Meta-Declarative Paradigm of Programming</b>, recognizing its
potential to automate many tedious routine tasks and significantly
reduce the effort and attention required from software developers. In
September of that year, I published the results of my experiments and
introduced the term <b>Meta-Declarative Paradigm of Programming</b>. While
I did not invent the concept, I articulated it clearly enough for it
to be accessible to a wide audience.
</p>

<p>
This paradigm facilitates developers in gaining a deeper understanding
of the core principles that underpin software design and
implementation. By offering insights into the declarative nature of
programming, it encourages developers to engage with code more
thoughtfully, thereby refining their problem-solving strategies.
</p>

<p>
Due to its reliance on natural language, the <b>Meta-Declarative
Paradigm</b> fosters a culture of reflection and abstraction. This can
enhance collaboration and spur innovation in software development. My
goal is to empower developers through this paradigm to create more
effective, efficient, and maintainable code, ultimately transforming
the landscape of software engineering.

<h3 id="org6860d5b">Linux</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6860d5b">
<p>
I installed my first Linux distribution, <b>RHEL4</b>, from a CD that I
serendipitously bought at a flea market in 2007. This experience was
an acute and palpable sensation, marking my liberation from
proprietary operating systems. Since then, I have explored various
distributions, including <b>Ubuntu</b>, <b>Debian</b>, <b>CentOS</b>, <b>AltLinux</b>,
<b>Gentoo</b>, <b>DamnSmallLinux</b>, <b>Fedora</b>, and <b>PuppyLinux</b>. I even create
a bootable USB stick to ran the i386 version of <b>Porteus</b>, a
portable Linux distribution.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, transitioning to cloud infrastructure was seamless for me,
beginning with my utilization of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and <b>EC2</b>
in 2011.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I am using <b>Debian Bookworm</b> as it strikes an optimal
balance between resilience and flexibility, allowing me to efficiently
handle a variety of tasks while ensuring system stability and
security.

<h3 id="org5e1ab55">Emacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5e1ab55">
<p>
My first encounter with <b>Emacs</b> was in 2011, and at that time, my lack
of experience made it seem strange and complex, which initially
repelled me. However, after gaining considerable experience with
various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), a clear
realization struck me:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All these commercial IDEs primarily rely on the mouse to navigate
and manipulate code, which typically <span class="underline">has only two buttons</span>. In
contrast, <b>Emacs</b> harnesses the power of the keyboard, featuring at
least <span class="underline">104 keys</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The advantages of this approach are evident: for a touch typist like
myself (a skill I have mastered since 2008), it is far more convenient
to use a keyboard for routine tasks in software development. With its
extensive array of keys, <b>Emacs</b> allows your fingers to memorize
shortcuts and commands, enabling a more efficient and fluid workflow.

<h3 id="org5104700">Python</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5104700">
<p>
My first encounter with a Python code snippet occurred around 2010,
and my initial impression was utterly astounding and captivating:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"It was like finally meeting a long-known, yet occasionally forgotten,
version of an algorithmic language that could comprehend your
intentions on the fly."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Everything in <b>Python</b> felt remarkably familiar to me, amplified a
hundredfold by an unnamed magician's unfathomable brilliance. The core
concepts were meticulously implemented, offering an elegant and
intuitive approach to harnessing the power of each string. What was
once pure rapture has transformed over the past 15 years into an
enduring source of joy and inspiration.
</p>

<p>
<b>Python</b> is the flexible and powerful tool I had always dreamed of
possessing to command machines—everything I envisioned is already
embedded within its capabilities.

<h3 id="org8a7c837">Literate Programming</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8a7c837">
<p>
In my approach to programming, I embrace the principles of literate
programming through the use of <code>Emacs</code> and its powerful <code>Babel</code>
capabilities. This methodology allows me to write documents that are
both human-readable and executable, explicitly demonstrating how the
code works in a seamless narrative.
</p>

<p>
By interweaving documentation with code, I strive to create a clear
and comprehensive explanation of my thought process and design
decisions. With <code>Babel</code>, I can embed code snippets directly within my
documents, ensuring that the implementations are not only functional
but also accompanied by detailed comments and explanations. This
technique fosters a deeper understanding of the code and makes it
accessible to others, facilitating collaboration and knowledge
sharing.
