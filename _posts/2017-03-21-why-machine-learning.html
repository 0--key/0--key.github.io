<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org92a3f7e">
<p>
It is very hard to write programs that solve problems like recognizing a
three-dimensional object from a novel viewpoint in new lighting
conditions in a cluttered scene.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We don’t know what program to write because we don’t know how its
done in our brain.</li>
<li>Even if we had a good idea about how to do it, the program might
be horrendously complicated.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is hard to write a program to compute the probability that a
credit card transaction is fraudulent.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There may not be any rules that are both simple and reliable. We
need to combine a very large number of weak rules.</li>
<li>Fraud is a moving target. The program needs to keep changing.</li>

<h3 id="org74de5db">The Machine Learning Approach</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org74de5db">
<p>
Instead of writing a program by hand for each specific task, we collect
lots of examples that specify the correct output for a given input.
A machine learning algorithm then takes these examples and produces
a program that does the job.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The program produced by the learning algorithm may look very
different from a typical hand-written program. It may contain
millions of numbers.</li>
<li>If we do it right, the program works for new cases as well as the
ones we trained it on.</li>
<li>If the data changes the program can change too by training on the
new data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Massive amounts of computation are now cheaper than paying
someone to write a task-specific program.

coefficients. Extract a new vector about every 10 mille seconds.</li>

coefficients to place bets on which part of which phoneme is being
spoken.</li>

fitting the acoustic data and also fitting a model of the kinds of
things people say.</li>

Mohamed are now replacing the previous machine learning method

<li>The goal in selecting each action is to maximize the expected sum</li>

<li>We usually use a discount factor for delayed rewards so that we</li>

  Reinforcement learning is difficult:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The rewards are typically delayed so its hard to know where we</li>

went wrong (or right).
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A scalar reward does not supply much information.</li>
</ul>

  This course cannot cover everything and reinforcement learning is one
of the important topics we will not cover.Unsupervised learning
  For about 40 years, unsupervised learning was largely ignored by the
machine learning community
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some widely used definitions of machine learning actually excluded it.</li>
<li>Many researchers thought that clustering was the only form of</li>
</ul>
<p>
unsupervised learning.
  It is hard to say what the aim of unsupervised learning is.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One major aim is to create an internal representation of the input that</li>
</ul>
<p>
is useful for subsequent supervised or reinforcement learning.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can compute the distance to a surface by using the disparity</li>
</ul>
<p>
between two images. But you don’t want to learn to compute
disparities by stubbing your toe thousands of times.Other goals for unsupervised learning
