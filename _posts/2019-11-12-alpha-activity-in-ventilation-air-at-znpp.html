Registration of low alpha radioactivity on the surface of aerosol
analytic filter after transmission of 0.288E+02 cubical meters of
outlet ventilation air through it.

<h2 id="org7c22240">Method description</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c22240">
<p>
An outlet ventilation air aeroslols sedimentation on the surface of
analytical filter 0.2E-04 square meters in diameter with a constant
flow 20 L/minute during 24 hours and further measurment of its
surface pollution by scintillation alpha-detectors.

<h2 id="org835f507">Results</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org835f507">
<p>
Each sample has initially alpha radioactivity in the range from
0.8E+00 Bq to 0.17E+01 Bq;
</p>

<p>
Alpha-radioactivity of each sample has decreased twice in an one
hour.
</p>

<p>
Alpha-radioactivity becomes completely undetectable after 2 days for
every sample.

<h2 id="org0ea2343">Analysis</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0ea2343">
<p>
Therefore all these measurments are implemented by the set of 3
different radiometers and they are almost identical in value, it
might be considered that this observed phenomenon is truly detection
of alpha-particles.
</p>

<p>
As any free source of information doesn't contain any relevant
information about that particular observations, it might be
perceived as a new, initially detected phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind that air in the points of aspiration is a mixture of
all outlet ventilation systems of each power unit and fact that most
of that systems don't contain alpha-radioactive isotopes in a
measurable amount, it might be concluded that on average exist
several sources of alpha-active radionucliedes exhausting in several
particular points.
