<h2 id="orgc96ed70">What is a mental model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc96ed70">
<p>
In this video you'll learn <i>nine different mental models</i> that you can
use to solve difficult problems, see the world in ways that no one
else could even fathom and all around. Just improve how you think if
you're wondering <i>what a mental model is</i>, - 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It's simply a representation of how the world works.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We operate in a very complex world and it's impossible to truly
understand all the different intricacies of everything that we
experience. So in order to help us we use these different models in
ideas that we do understand to aid us in learning about the things
that we don't understand. Here's a quick example:
</p>

<p>
Let's say an environmentalist of botanist and a business person walk
into a forest. They're all going to focus on different things. The
environmentalists may focus on the impact of climate change. The
business person is probably going to look at the forest and see the
immense value of the land and the botanist is going to focus on the
ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Each person essentially is simplifying the innate complexity of the
forest into something that that they could understand with the limited
knowledge. What they have while doing this isn't necessarily bad. What
they see is entirely limited to what they know and therefore they
can't see the full scope of the forest. So one thing they may end up
doing is <i>sharing their specialized knowledge with each other</i>. This
creates a scenario where each person develops a much more well-rounded
understanding of the forest, this is exactly what you do with <i>mental
models</i>: you'll learn the fundamental concepts of other disciplines to
help give you a bigger toolbox.
</p>

<p>
If you will to sort of see the world through the more models you have
the more lenses you can use while you look at the world and therefore
the <i>fewer blind spots</i> that you end up having.
</p>

<p>
So now that you understand what a mental model is in the importance of
using all of these different models throughout your life. Let's learn
what some of those models actually are and how you can use them.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org36e60d7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org36e60d7">The Map is not the Territory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org36e60d7">
<p>
One of the most important mental models to learn is <span class="underline"><i>map is not the
territory</i></span>.  This model teaches that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The representation of reality is not actual reality.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even the best maps are imperfect because they are naturally reductions
of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with
perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction of the thing it, -
would <i>just be the thing</i>.
</p>

<p>
Like imagine trying to navigate New York with a map the size of New
York in your pocket. There are just so many obvious reasons why that
won't work at a more practical level. The graph or the spreadsheet of
the financials of the company isn't actually the financials of the
company. So it doesn't accurately represent the real important numbers
in the dollars in your bank account. The information about a project
from your direct report isn't the actual project, so before making
decisions based on these assumptions and maps and reports and
summaries you have to ensure that you understand 100 percent that
there <i>reduction of the thing is not the thing</i>.
</p>

<p>
So make sure you get familiar with the actual territory before you
make an important decision and not just go based on whatever the map
is saying.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3b64a79" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3b64a79">Circle of Competence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3b64a79">
<p>
<b>Circle of competence</b> is simple. Each one of us through our
experience and our study has built up useful knowledge on different
areas of the world. Some of those areas are inside of our circle of
competence and these are the things that we understand well.
</p>

<p>
If you work as a marketing director, - <code>marketing</code> is probably within
your circle of competence. Product might be around the edges and
engineering is well outside of your circle of competence. So now when
you make a decision you can evaluate where the scope of that decision
lies relative to your circle of competence. If it falls inside of it
you can make the decision with a confidence, knowing that you have the
expertise to make the decision.
</p>

<p>
If the decision falls outside of the scope of your circle of
competence, - that's when you can consult an expert whose circle of
competence contains that decision.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tom Watson</b> the founder of IBM put it best when he said
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I'm not genius. I'm smart in spots and I <i>stay around</i> those spots.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We should all aim to do the same.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8eae17d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8eae17d">Second Order Thinking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8eae17d">
<p>
Almost everyone can anticipate the immediate results of their actions.
This type of <b>first order thinking</b> is easy and safe but it's also a
way to ensure that you get the same results that everyone else does.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Second order thinking</i></b> is thinking further ahead and <code>thinking
holistically</code>. It not only requires us to consider our actions and
their immediate consequences, but also the consequences of those
consequences.
</p>

<p>
There's a really famous story about this that is now called the Cobra
effect. And it's about in the 1900s British Colonials ruled India at
the time. But there was a massive Cobra problem — they were just
everywhere.
</p>

<p>
What the government did was: they decided to pay citizens to kill
snakes — so citizens would kill the snakes and then bring them to the
government, and they get paid for. Kind of like a bounty system. What
ended up happening was the citizens just started breeding snakes — so
they could kill them to make more money.
</p>

<p>
Once the government found out about this and ended the Bounty program
the citizens now had no need for all these newborn snakes, so they just
let them loose in the street making the Cobra problem even worse off
than it was before.
</p>

<p>
This story illustrates the perfect example of what happens when
someone doesn't consider the <i>second order effects</i> of their
decisions.
</p>

<p>
You might be wondering where I'm getting this content from and it's
from our actual books. We've written three books on mental models and
how to use them in your life. We've also written hundreds of blog
posts on our site <a href="http://fs.blog">fs.blog</a>, so if you want to learn more about any of
these and go into more detail you can visit our site. Again that's

below.

<div id="outline-container-org129727e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org129727e">Probabilistic thinking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org129727e">
<p>
<b>Probabilistic thinking</b> is essentially trying to estimate, using some
tools of math and logic, the likelihood of any specific outcome
happening. <i>The world as complex as it is</i>: it is very rarely black
and white, so instead of deciding things as either <code>happening or not
happening</code> probabilistic thinking encourages us to assign a
probability estimate to that thing happening to get a more accurate
result.
</p>

<p>
As a simple example let's say you read a headline in a local paper
that says car break-ins on the rise now. Without thinking
probabilistically you probably might start freaking out about leaving
your car parked on the side of the street, but using probabilistic
thinking you can add a bit more context to this.
</p>

<p>
For example, let's say you know that violent crime has been declining
to its lowest rates in decades. Your city is now safer than it has
been ever. Let's also say that the chance of your car getting broken
into last year was one in ten thousand or point zero one percent. The
article states with accuracy probably that this type of crime has
doubled it. It is now two in ten thousand or point zero two percent
now. Is that worth being terribly worried about? Probably not, so the
prior information here is key when we factor it in we realize that our
safety isn't really being compromised.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2be4214" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2be4214">Inversion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2be4214">
<p>
<b>Inversion</b> is a powerful tool to improve your thinking because it
helps you identify and remove different obstacles to success. As a
thinking tool it means approaching a situation from the opposite end
of the natural starting point. When most of us start a new project
we'd like to think about what success would look like. And then we set
the goals and priorities around getting there using inversion.
</p>

<p>
Though you think about what failure would look like and what might
cause that. Then you set goals and priorities to ensure you avoid
whatever it is. That might cause that failure, instead of thinking
about success and aiming for whatever that looks like. You think about
failure and make sure you stay away from whatever that looks like.
</p>

<p>
Charlie Munger has famously said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All I want to know is where I'm going to die so I'll never go there.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org3ee17ec" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3ee17ec">Occam’s Razor</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3ee17ec">
<blockquote>
<p>
Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is the essence of <b>Occam's razor</b>: a classic principle of logic
and problem solving. Instead of wasting your time trying to disprove
very complex and intertwined scenarios, <span class="underline">you can make decisions more
confidently</span> by basing them on the <i>explanation that has the fewest
moving parts</i>.
</p>

<p>
A simple example of Occam's razor is used to find the truth among
conspiracy theories. Most conspiracy theories have many complicated
and interwoven threads that seemingly paint a bigger picture, but for
conspiracy theory. To be true all of those individual threads need to
be proven 100% accurate. That's really hard to do — it's much simpler and
much more rational honestly to assume the logical explanation, because
it has fewer dependencies.
</p>

<p>
For example: the Titanic hitting an iceberg and sinking. It is pretty
cut and dry, there's not many dependencies. On the other hand a lot of
things had to have happened for the <code>Freemasons</code> to cause sinking of
the Titanic which is believed by.
</p>

<p>
Some doctors often look for the simplest solution to an ailment, and
scientists usually start with the least complicated hypothesis to
disprove, and then they go from there.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6696857" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6696857">Hanlon’s Razor</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6696857">
<p>
Another helpful razor is <b>Hanlon's Razor</b>. This model says that we
should <i>not attribute to maliciousness that which is easily explained
by incompetence</i>.
</p>

<p>
Essentially just because someone does something that makes you mad or
upsets you doesn't mean they're out to get you, like we so often
believe. It's far more likely that <i>they are just ignorant of
something</i> or something else is going on in their life.
</p>

<p>
For example if a good friend hasn't responded to your messages lately.
Using hanlon's razor we can assume it's far more likely that they are
busy with work or something personal came up than it is, that they no
longer want to be your friend.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb0ac4ad" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb0ac4ad">Reciprocity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb0ac4ad">
<p>
<b>Reciprocity or the principle of reciprocation</b>.
</p>

<p>
If we want to get super fancy it states that <i>for every action there
is an equal and opposite reaction</i>. In life the same is true: if you
treat someone with kindness odds are they are going to reciprocate
kindness back to you, but the opposite is also true. If you treat
someone poorly — you can't be surprised when they do the same to you.
</p>

<p>
Reciprocity prompts us to rewrite the Golden Rule, - a wee saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Do onto others knowing that something will be done onto you.
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org709bb45" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org709bb45">Activation Energy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org709bb45">
<p>
<b>Activation energy</b> is a model from chemistry and it tells us that a
chemical reaction needs a certain amount of energy before it can begin
working. One way to increase energy in a chemical reaction is with a
catalyst. This is something that can be added to a reaction to lower
the activation energy that is required.
</p>

<p>
Using this practically in our lives we can identify some catalysts
like coffee or inspiration. Even that make doing hard work or a big
project easier. Writing along paper is a really difficult task and
takes a lot of activation energy to start and get going. If you drink
coffee you can help lower that activation energy and get you going a
lot quicker.
</p>

<p>
When someone you know is struggling to get started on a project or
finish a project try to identify what's causing so much activation
energy to be required and see if you can somehow lower that threshold.
