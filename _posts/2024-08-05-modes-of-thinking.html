<h3 id="org4ef253e">Definition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4ef253e">
<p>
Meta-learning, often referred to as "learning how to learn," involves
understanding and managing one's own learning processes. This
encompasses a range of skills, attitudes, and strategies that empower
adults to take control of their learning experiences.

<h2 id="org667687c">Bloom's Revised Taxonomy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org667687c">
<p>
Bloom's Revised Taxonomy is an update to the original taxonomy of
educational objectives created by Benjamin Bloom and colleagues
in 1956. The revised version, developed by a group of cognitive
psychologists, curriculum theorists, instructional researchers, and
testing and assessment specialists, was published in 2001. It provides
a more dynamic framework for classifying educational goals,
objectives, and standards, focusing on the development of cognitive
skills and critical thinking.

"Perceived Effort as Poor Learning: The Misinterpreted-Effort
Hypothesis of How Experienced Effort and Perceived Learning Relate to
Study Strategy Choice" by Afton Kirk-Johnson and Others
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9b18e52" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9b18e52">Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9b18e52">
<p>
The paper by Afton Kirk-Johnson and colleagues investigates the
relationship between experienced effort in learning activities and
perceived learning outcomes. The central theme is the
"misinterpreted-effort hypothesis," which posits that individuals
often misinterpret the effort they exert during learning as an
indication of poor learning performance, leading to suboptimal study
strategy choices.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8ea91b7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8ea91b7">Key Hypothesis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8ea91b7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The "misinterpreted-effort hypothesis" suggests that learners may
mistakenly equate higher effort with lower levels of learning due to
discomfort or cognitive strain, thereby influencing their selection
of learning strategies.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org925773e">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>To explore the relationship between perceived effort and perceived
learning.</li>
<li>To examine how this relationship affects the choice of study
strategies.</li>
<li>To understand the cognitive mechanisms that underlie the
misinterpretation of learning effort.</li>

<div id="outline-container-orgfa3ce21" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfa3ce21">Methodology</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfa3ce21">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The study employed experimental designs involving various learning
tasks.</li>
<li>Participants were asked to engage in study activities and report
their perceived effort and perceived learning.</li>
<li>The research measured the impact of these perceptions on subsequent
choices of study strategies, such as rereading versus practice
testing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc947b46" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc947b46">Findings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc947b46">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Effort and Learning Perception</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Participants often perceived higher effort as indicative of
poorer learning, even when this was not the case.</li>
<li>The relationship between effort and perceived learning was
influenced by task difficulty and familiarity.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Study Strategy Choice</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As a result of misinterpreting effort, participants were more
likely to choose easier, less effective study strategies (e.g.,
rereading) over more challenging, effective ones (e.g., practice
testing).</li>
<li>This misinterpretation was found to lead to less effective
learning outcomes in the long term.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Cognitive Mechanisms</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The study suggested that cognitive strain and discomfort during
challenging tasks may be misinterpreted as failure, affecting
motivation and strategy selection.</li>
<li>It highlighted the need to educate learners about the nature of
productive struggle and effortful learning to correct these
misconceptions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0502f20" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0502f20">Implications</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0502f20">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Educational Practice</b>: Educators should emphasize that effort and
cognitive strain are not inherently negative and often correlate
with deeper learning.</li>
<li><b>Learner Awareness</b>: Training learners to recognize the value of
effortful processing and encouraging the use of evidence-based study
strategies.</li>
<li><b>Study Strategy Design</b>: Development of interventions to help
learners make better-informed decisions about their study strategies
based on actual performance rather than perceived effort.</li>

<h3 id="org101724f">The Marrow</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org101724f">
<p>
The research underscores the importance of understanding the
subjective experience of effort in learning contexts. Addressing the
misinterpreted-effort hypothesis can lead to more effective learning
behaviors and improved educational outcomes, by helping learners
differentiate between effort and effective learning.
