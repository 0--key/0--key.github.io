<h3 id="orgaff9f8a">Defining Values</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaff9f8a">
<p>
Let's get into the nitty-gritty a little bit. What is a value? How
do we define these things? What do they look like? How are they
different?
</p>

<p>
Modern value theory within psychology has been significantly shaped by
the work of Israeli researcher <i>Scholom Schwarz</i>. He's considered the
godfather of this field. Schwarz defined values as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"beliefs about trans-situational goals varying in importance, which
serve as guiding principles in the life of a person or a group."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This definition might sound complex, so let's break it down.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgdcea1e6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdcea1e6">Key Characteristics of Values</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdcea1e6">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Linked with Emotion
</p>

<p>
Values are inherently emotional. By definition, they are considered
the most important things in life. Consider, for example, the
emotions displayed by protesters or the intense anger felt when
someone wrongs you — these reactions are tied to your values being
challenged.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Motivate Action
</p>

<p>
Values not only define what you want to pursue in life, but they
also fuel the energy behind those pursuits. For instance, if you
value status, it will not only guide your goals but also energize
your actions and excitement about opportunities.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Apply Across Contexts
</p>

<p>
Values maintain their importance across different contexts. If you
value honesty, it should hold true at work, in relationships, and
with family. There's no context where you disregard your value if
it’s truly a value.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Standards for Moral Judgments
</p>

<p>
Values serve as standards by which we make moral judgments, both of
ourselves and others. For example, if personal freedom is a value,
you measure yourself and others against this benchmark.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Ranked Hierarchically
</p>

<p>
People have a hierarchy of values that define their identities and
guide their decisions. This hierarchy prioritizes what is most
important to each individual.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Involve Trade-Offs
</p>

<p>
Prioritizing one value often requires devaluing others. For
example, if you highly value personal freedom, you might place less
importance on stability or routine, seeing them as constraints.
</p></li>

<h3 id="org4be34b8">Core Questions Values Address</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4be34b8">
<p>
Values answer the fundamental questions of life: What matters? What is
worth pursuing? What kind of person do I want to become? These are
deep philosophical questions that define the essence of who you are.

<div id="outline-container-org20cd84f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org20cd84f">Values vs. Psychological Needs vs. Preferences</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org20cd84f">

<div id="outline-container-org1c2b6f0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1c2b6f0">Understanding Psychological Needs vs. Values</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1c2b6f0">
<p>
Let's clarify the differences between psychological needs and values
as we move forward. Psychological needs are universal — we all have
them in varying proportions. These needs are survival-based, such as
the need for food. Without these needs being met, like food, survival
becomes impossible, and there's no room for negotiation on this.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, there are certain fundamental psychological needs, such as
social connection and belonging, that everyone requires. While the
basic needs are the same for everyone, the strategies to meet them can
vary vastly.
</p>

<p>
Values, as explained by Scholom Schwarz, serve as strategies to
fulfill our psychological needs. For instance, while fulfilling the
need for connection and belonging, some may lean towards values of
benevolence and generosity, while others may focus on loyalty or group
affiliation.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgeaabcbc" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgeaabcbc">Differences Between Values and Preferences</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgeaabcbc">
<p>
Preferences differ fundamentally from values and psychological
needs. Preferences are simple tastes or choices between non-impactful
options, lacking deep emotional connection or identity reflection. For
example, preferring steak over chicken does not constitute a value;
it's merely a taste preference that holds no significant emotional
weight or purpose.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf92123c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf92123c">Emotional Connection and Flexibility of Values</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf92123c">
<p>
Values are tightly linked to emotions, changing throughout life based
on experiences. They aren't static; they evolve as life's
circumstances and personal insights shift. This changeability
distinguishes them from the permanence of psychological needs.
</p>

<p>
It's crucial to recognize that values are not easily altered through
logic or reasoning; they're deeply tied to emotional experiences and
strategies developed during one's life and influenced by the
surrounding culture and environment.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org934628c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org934628c">Empathy and Emotional Sensitivity in Values</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org934628c">
<p>
Understanding values can enhance empathy. Recognizing that someone's
differing values are their strategies for meeting their needs can
reduce judgment. Values provoke strong emotions, be it in passion or
discomfort, especially when questioned or challenged.
</p>

<p>
In this episode, the deep exploration of values might evoke such
emotions, stirring reflection or even discomfort in the listener. This
isn't a straightforward topic; it's central to personal identity and
emotional well-being.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org32fb5c9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org32fb5c9">Values as a Potentially Unsettling Topic</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org32fb5c9">
<p>
Questioning one's values can be one of the most challenging yet
enlightening psychological tasks. It's common for conflicts between
values to arise in life, often addressed in the realm of therapy to
navigate such complexities.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5fb883e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5fb883e">Sum Them Up</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5fb883e">
<p>
Finally, how these ideas affect your need for belonging or
connection—factors like perceived security or need for novelty—vary
individually. Each person’s psychological makeup determines their
unique blend of needs and the values developed as strategies to meet
them.

<h4 id="org996c185">Introduction to Schwartz's Values Wheel</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org996c185">
<p>
We're going to explore multiple frameworks to help clarify the
abstract nature of values. Understanding these should give you clarity
on personal preferences and life challenges. We'll start with
Schwartz's Values Wheel, which was developed through extensive
cross-cultural surveys across more than 70 countries. This wheel
defines ten core universal human values. We all possess these values,
though in varying proportions, which influence our individual
identities.

<div id="outline-container-org9a64c94" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9a64c94">The Ten Core Values</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9a64c94">
<ol class="org-ol">

<div id="outline-container-orgac8b2dd" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgac8b2dd">The Wheel Structure and Internal Tensions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgac8b2dd">
<p>
Schwartz placed these values in a wheel because of the inherent
tensions between different value groups. Opposite groups on the wheel
often have conflicting drives. For instance, values of "Openness to
Change" conflict with "Conservation" values. Imagine individuals
passionate about personal freedom; they are usually more open to
change and exploration, often at odds with those who adhere strictly
to tradition and security.
</p>

<p>
Another example of internal tension within the wheel is between the
values of "Self-Transcendence" and "Self-Enhancement". While
"Self-Transcendence" values emphasize group orientation and
selflessness, "Self-Enhancement" values focus on personal achievement
and power.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org92f2c2c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org92f2c2c">Synergy Among Neighboring Values</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org92f2c2c">
<p>
Values positioned next to each other on the wheel often harmonize
well, such as "Universalism" and "Benevolence", or "Self-Direction"
and "Stimulation". These adjacent values support one another, offering
complementary pathways for personal development.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org550248e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org550248e">Political Compass Parallel</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org550248e">
<p>
Interestingly, the dimensions of the Values Wheel parallel frameworks
used in political science, notably the political compass, which
evaluates political beliefs along similar axes. These parallels
suggest that fundamental human value tensions are mirrored in larger
societal and political structures.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga051b97" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga051b97">Understanding and Navigating Internal Conflicts</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga051b97">
<p>
Awareness of these internal tensions helps normalize personal
conflicts we face. Recognizing which values are in conflict can help
individuals understand difficulties they might experience, such as
anxiety or sacrifice, in their pursuit of what they hold dear.
</p>

<p>
When faced with challenging decisions, consider which values each
option represents and which values you are willing to compromise. This
reflection can provide clarity and help accept past choices,
understanding that sacrifices were made in favor of deeply held
values.
