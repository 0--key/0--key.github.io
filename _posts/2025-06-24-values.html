The whole episode name is "How to Find and Live by Your Values", the
capter name is "What are Values?" and the particular topic is
"Values vs. Psychological Needs vs. Preferences".
</p>

<p>
Next particular topic is "Schwartz's Values Wheel".
</p>

<p>
Don't tag the chapters, please.
</p>

<p>
```
 Okay so we're gonna  
</p>

<p>
go through you know again because values it's 
such a abstract topic Um we're going to go through  
</p>

<p>
like four or five frameworks here um to help 
people like really get a handle on this And um  
</p>

<p>
hopefully by the time we get through all of them 
the listener is going to have like a really clear  
</p>

<p>
idea of kind of like okay I I can see myself in 
each of those I now I understand like why I care  
</p>

<p>
about these things and I don't care about those 
things or now I understand why I'm having this  
</p>

<p>
issue in my life So the first one I want to talk 
about it comes from Schwarz himself comes from the  
</p>

<p>
man himself So to give a little bit of background 
this so the first thing we're going to cover is  
</p>

<p>
Schwarz's values wheel and this is the result 
of dozens and dozens of massive cross-cultural  
</p>

<p>
surveys across more than 70 different countries 
And so this was unlike many things in psychology  
</p>

<p>
This is this has been replicated across many 
many cultures Um and it has been found it has  
</p>

<p>
indeed been found to be quite universal Um and 
essentially Schwarz narrowed the core human  
</p>

<p>
values down to 10 of them And these are universal 
So it's important to know that we all have all of  
</p>

<p>
these What changes is the proportion And he mapped 
these out in a wheel And we'll talk about why he  
</p>

<p>
put them in a wheel in a second So the first two 
are he called them the self-enhancement values  
</p>

<p>
First one is achievement which is self-explanatory 
Second one is power Then there's the conservation  
</p>

<p>
values He has tradition security and conformity 
And then there's the self-trcendence values One is  
</p>

<p>
universalism which is basically kind of feeling 
at one with everybody around you And then the  
</p>

<p>
second one is benevolence which you could think 
of as charity being helpful altruism things like  
</p>

<p>
that Then he has the openness to change values 
which is stimulation and self-direction You could  
</p>

<p>
think of self-direction as personal freedom or 
autonomy And then finally the 10th is of course  
</p>

<p>
hedenism which is I think it's interesting that 
I guess at some point he probably recognized he's  
</p>

<p>
like well yeah clearly people value pleasure right 
otherwise they wouldn't be sacrificing all these  
</p>

<p>
other things for it so you have to throw that 
in there right it's a category of its own but  
</p>

<p>
yeah exactly he placed these 10 values in a wheel 
because what he noticed is that certain groups of  
</p>

<p>
values are have an inherent internal tension 
with each other So for example the openness to  
</p>

<p>
change values of stimulation and self-direction 
have an inherent tension with the conservation  
</p>

<p>
values tradition security conformity And if you 
think about it think about think about a person in  
</p>

<p>
your life who most embodies somebody who's open to 
change and values stimulation and personal freedom  
</p>

<p>
You're probably imagining some hippie- dippy 
person who's like always traveling around and  
</p>

<p>
going to festivals and partying and you know just 
living life going with the flow with everything  
</p>

<p>
What is the complete and utter opposite of 
that it's somebody who's like super uptight  
</p>

<p>
very traditional demands conformity security all 
the time Uh and so like basically it's no matter  
</p>

<p>
where you are on the the values wheel there's 
something across from you that is there's an  
</p>

<p>
inherent tension with that right self-trcendence 
the craving to to identify with the group around  
</p>

<p>
you to help others to be supportive of others 
to give yourself up for others is diametrically  
</p>

<p>
opposed to the values of self-enhancement which 
is the achievement of status growth of power  
</p>

<p>
um the dominance o over yourself and others So 
all of these values exist within us And if you're  
</p>

<p>
watching on YouTube we're going to have the values 
wheel up on screen while I'm talking about it  
</p>

<p>
Um if you're listening you can we've got the 
values wheel It's in the PDF guide if you go  
</p>

<p>
to solvepodcast.com/values You can get it there Um 
not only do values across from each other on the  
</p>

<p>
wheel uh are at odds with each other but values 
that are next to each other they harmonize well  
</p>

<p>
with one another So you know universalism and 
benevolence will harmonize with one another The  
</p>

<p>
um self-direction harmonizes with hedonism 
stimulation same thing So everybody gets gets  
</p>

<p>
the idea Now I think the brilliant insight 
here is that Schwarz identified two inherent  
</p>

<p>
tensions that are always at play within each of 
us all the time So the first one is openness to  
</p>

<p>
change versus conservation The second one is 
self-enhancement versus self-trcendence Pop  
</p>

<p>
quiz Can you think of any framework that reflects 
these same two dimensions i mean it sounds very  
</p>

<p>
political to me So is there a political science 
framework or something that does this or Good  
</p>

<p>
guess Drew Bernie Okay So so a lot of people 
online have probably seen a thing called the  
</p>

<p>
political compass and there's two so there's the 
x-axis which is like left and right or it's really  
</p>

<p>
it's like group oriented versus individual 
oriented and then there's the y-axis which  
</p>

<p>
is libertarian versus authoritarian So it's it's 
like rigid controls and um uh personal liberty  
</p>

<p>
and freedom So chances are if you've been on the 
internet since the 2000s like old people like us  
</p>

<p>
uh you've taken a quiz at some point that's mapped 
you to this political compass And interestingly  
</p>

<p>
this I couldn't find any any information that 
like explicitly said that this political compass  
</p>

<p>
was based on Schwarz's research But I do find it 
absolutely fascinating that the two dimensions  
</p>

<p>
by which we measure people's political beliefs are 
also the same two spectrums that Schwarz found for  
</p>

<p>
people's fundamental values We're going to come 
back to this again as well This is not the first  
</p>

<p>
time we've heard of these two dimensions Right so 
I think it's it's hugely important to understand  
</p>

<p>
these inherent tensions in our values because for 
one it just normalizes internal conflict I can't  
</p>

<p>
tell you how many times I've gotten emails from 
readers and listeners over the years who they'll  
</p>

<p>
kind of go through like some problem in their 
life and really when you boil it down it's just  
</p>

<p>
that like they care about a thing caring about 
it is hard and it it's stressful and they feel  
</p>

<p>
really anxious and maybe upset over something 
like the price of caring about that thing and  
</p>

<p>
then they email me like asking how they can make 
the the struggle or the sacrifice go away I just  
</p>

<p>
think that like the thing that gets lost so 
often is that to care about anything deeply  
</p>

<p>
you are going to experience proportional internal 
conflict to caring about that thing right like  
</p>

<p>
the more you sacrifice for anything in your life 
the more difficult it's going to make other areas  
</p>

<p>
of your life Like because the more you're going 
to have to give up and the more you're going to  
</p>

<p>
have to compromise and the more you're going to 
have to let go of opportunities I think this the  
</p>

<p>
other reason this is super important is is that 
it it it helps us navigate difficult choices in  
</p>

<p>
our lives right like it it can clarify what the 
pros and cons of choosing a certain path might be  
</p>

<p>
if you've got a difficult decision in front of 
you and two different choices that both look  
</p>

<p>
good If you kind of think about like what are the 
values being represented by each of those choices  
</p>

<p>
um and which of those two values are you willing 
to compromise on or give up and which ones are you  
</p>

<p>
not can help you make that decision So if you're 
somebody who who is upset over a lost opportunity  
</p>

<p>
or something that happened in your past that you 
know you wish you could go back and change or you  
</p>

<p>
sometimes wonder about um understanding your 
values can help you look at that situation and  
</p>

<p>
and really come to terms with with being okay 
with that loss being okay with what you gave  
</p>

<p>
up because it was ultimately for something you 
cared about

<h3 id="orgaff9f8a">Defining Values</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaff9f8a">
<p>
Let's get into the nitty-gritty a little bit. What is a value? How
do we define these things? What do they look like? How are they
different?
</p>

<p>
Modern value theory within psychology has been significantly shaped by
the work of Israeli researcher <i>Scholom Schwarz</i>. He's considered the
godfather of this field. Schwarz defined values as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"beliefs about trans-situational goals varying in importance, which
serve as guiding principles in the life of a person or a group."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This definition might sound complex, so let's break it down.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdcea1e6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdcea1e6">Key Characteristics of Values</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdcea1e6">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Linked with Emotion
</p>

<p>
Values are inherently emotional. By definition, they are considered
the most important things in life. Consider, for example, the
emotions displayed by protesters or the intense anger felt when
someone wrongs you — these reactions are tied to your values being
challenged.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Motivate Action
</p>

<p>
Values not only define what you want to pursue in life, but they
also fuel the energy behind those pursuits. For instance, if you
value status, it will not only guide your goals but also energize
your actions and excitement about opportunities.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Apply Across Contexts
</p>

<p>
Values maintain their importance across different contexts. If you
value honesty, it should hold true at work, in relationships, and
with family. There's no context where you disregard your value if
it’s truly a value.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Standards for Moral Judgments
</p>

<p>
Values serve as standards by which we make moral judgments, both of
ourselves and others. For example, if personal freedom is a value,
you measure yourself and others against this benchmark.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Ranked Hierarchically
</p>

<p>
People have a hierarchy of values that define their identities and
guide their decisions. This hierarchy prioritizes what is most
important to each individual.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Involve Trade-Offs
</p>

<p>
Prioritizing one value often requires devaluing others. For
example, if you highly value personal freedom, you might place less
importance on stability or routine, seeing them as constraints.

<h3 id="org4be34b8">Core Questions Values Address</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4be34b8">
<p>
Values answer the fundamental questions of life: What matters? What is
worth pursuing? What kind of person do I want to become? These are
deep philosophical questions that define the essence of who you are.

<h4 id="org1c2b6f0">Understanding Psychological Needs vs. Values</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1c2b6f0">
<p>
Let's clarify the differences between psychological needs and values
as we move forward. Psychological needs are universal — we all have
them in varying proportions. These needs are survival-based, such as
the need for food. Without these needs being met, like food, survival
becomes impossible, and there's no room for negotiation on this.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, there are certain fundamental psychological needs, such as
social connection and belonging, that everyone requires. While the
basic needs are the same for everyone, the strategies to meet them can
vary vastly.
</p>

<p>
Values, as explained by Scholom Schwarz, serve as strategies to
fulfill our psychological needs. For instance, while fulfilling the
need for connection and belonging, some may lean towards values of
benevolence and generosity, while others may focus on loyalty or group
affiliation.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgeaabcbc" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgeaabcbc">Differences Between Values and Preferences</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgeaabcbc">
<p>
Preferences differ fundamentally from values and psychological
needs. Preferences are simple tastes or choices between non-impactful
options, lacking deep emotional connection or identity reflection. For
example, preferring steak over chicken does not constitute a value;
it's merely a taste preference that holds no significant emotional
weight or purpose.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf92123c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf92123c">Emotional Connection and Flexibility of Values</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf92123c">
<p>
Values are tightly linked to emotions, changing throughout life based
on experiences. They aren't static; they evolve as life's
circumstances and personal insights shift. This changeability
distinguishes them from the permanence of psychological needs.
</p>

<p>
It's crucial to recognize that values are not easily altered through
logic or reasoning; they're deeply tied to emotional experiences and
strategies developed during one's life and influenced by the
surrounding culture and environment.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h4 id="org934628c">Empathy and Emotional Sensitivity in Values</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org934628c">
<p>
Understanding values can enhance empathy. Recognizing that someone's
differing values are their strategies for meeting their needs can
reduce judgment. Values provoke strong emotions, be it in passion or
discomfort, especially when questioned or challenged.
</p>

<p>
In this episode, the deep exploration of values might evoke such
emotions, stirring reflection or even discomfort in the listener. This
isn't a straightforward topic; it's central to personal identity and
emotional well-being.

<h4 id="org32fb5c9">Values as a Potentially Unsettling Topic</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org32fb5c9">
<p>
Questioning one's values can be one of the most challenging yet
enlightening psychological tasks. It's common for conflicts between
values to arise in life, often addressed in the realm of therapy to
navigate such complexities.

<h4 id="org5fb883e">Sum Them Up</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5fb883e">
<p>
Finally, how these ideas affect your need for belonging or
connection—factors like perceived security or need for novelty—vary
individually. Each person’s psychological makeup determines their
unique blend of needs and the values developed as strategies to meet
them.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org996c185">
<p>
We're going to explore multiple frameworks to help clarify the
abstract nature of values. Understanding these should give you clarity
on personal preferences and life challenges. We'll start with
Schwartz's Values Wheel, which was developed through extensive
cross-cultural surveys across more than 70 countries. This wheel
defines ten core universal human values. We all possess these values,
though in varying proportions, which influence our individual
identities.

<h4 id="orgac8b2dd">The Wheel Structure and Internal Tensions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgac8b2dd">
<p>
Schwartz placed these values in a wheel because of the inherent
tensions between different value groups. Opposite groups on the wheel
often have conflicting drives. For instance, values of "Openness to
Change" conflict with "Conservation" values. Imagine individuals
passionate about personal freedom; they are usually more open to
change and exploration, often at odds with those who adhere strictly
to tradition and security.
</p>

<p>
Another example of internal tension within the wheel is between the
values of "Self-Transcendence" and "Self-Enhancement". While
"Self-Transcendence" values emphasize group orientation and
selflessness, "Self-Enhancement" values focus on personal achievement
and power.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org92f2c2c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org92f2c2c">Synergy Among Neighboring Values</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org92f2c2c">
<p>
Values positioned next to each other on the wheel often harmonize
well, such as "Universalism" and "Benevolence", or "Self-Direction"
and "Stimulation". These adjacent values support one another, offering
complementary pathways for personal development.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org550248e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org550248e">Political Compass Parallel</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org550248e">
<p>
Interestingly, the dimensions of the Values Wheel parallel frameworks
used in political science, notably the political compass, which
evaluates political beliefs along similar axes. These parallels
suggest that fundamental human value tensions are mirrored in larger
societal and political structures.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga051b97" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga051b97">Understanding and Navigating Internal Conflicts</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga051b97">
<p>
Awareness of these internal tensions helps normalize personal
conflicts we face. Recognizing which values are in conflict can help
individuals understand difficulties they might experience, such as
anxiety or sacrifice, in their pursuit of what they hold dear.
</p>

<p>
When faced with challenging decisions, consider which values each
option represents and which values you are willing to compromise. This
reflection can provide clarity and help accept past choices,
understanding that sacrifices were made in favor of deeply held
values.
