<p>
Who is it?
</p>

<p>
Oh, you're not
intimidated, huh?
</p>

<p>
Oh, come on, Ken.
</p>

<p>
You're forgetting that
I'm one half of the world's
greatest mystery writing team.
</p>

<p>
You, uh, don't have gloves on,
your finger's not on the trigger,
</p>

<p>
and there are no bullets
in the cylinder.
</p>

<p>
You're right.
I'm a lousy practical joker.
</p>

<p>
What are you doing here
with that thing, anyway?
</p>

<p>
I was on my way down
to the cabin. I thought maybe
I could use it for protection.
</p>

<p>
Also came by to apologize.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For what?</li>
<li>For blowing my cork the other day.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I got out of line.
</p>

<p>
Forget it.
You know, that happens.
</p>

<p>
Nah. Shouldn't happen.
Not between you and me.
</p>

<p>
So, believe it or not, sir,
</p>

<p>
this is a peace pipe.
</p>

<p>
Bottoms up, Jim.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;In the middle&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of the morning?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, come on. Relax.
It's Saturday.
</p>

<p>
And in the mystery writer's soul,
it is always the middle of the night.
</p>

<p>
Oh! A toast.
</p>

<p>
Dear sir,
</p>

<p>
I give you&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
our divorce.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's not really
a divorce.
</p>

<p>
Oh, sure it is.
Come on. Let's be honest.
</p>

<p>
I mean, it's&#x2026;
There's no alimony, but, uh,
it is a termination.
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes.
And our dear little children.
</p>

<p>
All &lt;i&gt;1 5 of them.
</p>

<p>
Fifty million copies.
</p>

<p>
And to the lady who made it all possible,
the greatest sleuth in the world,
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Melville,
</p>

<p>
whom we brought to life
and now we're about to bury.
</p>

<p>
Come on, Ken.
</p>

<p>
You're making me feel guilty.
All I want to do is write on my own.
</p>

<p>
You're right.
I am being selfish.
</p>

<p>
Okay, my boy.
My blessings on your solo flight.
</p>

<p>
Thanks.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate it.
</p>

<p>
After all, friendship is more important
than partnership. Right?
</p>

<p>
Here's to our friendship.
</p>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
And now, sir,
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna kidnap you.
</p>

<p>
What?
The aforementioned cabin&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
which has been finished
for over six months now&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
You haven't seen it.
You're gonna be
my first male guest.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I can't, Ken. Not now.
Well, why can't you?
</p>

<p>
It's all the way down
in San Diego.
Oh, it's a couple of hours' drive.
</p>

<p>
I'll have you home
before midnight.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, well, I promised Joanna
I'd take her to dinner
and a show.
</p>

<p>
Aw, that's easy. You pick up that phone,
you say, ' Honey, I'm gonna be working
late at the office tonight." Come on.
</p>

<p>
Soon as we get down there,
we uncork another bottle,
and then we go fishing.
</p>

<p>
Well, I&#x2026;
You know what your trouble,
old buddy is&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I mean, you're afraid
to unwind even for a day.
Oh, no, I'm not.
</p>

<p>
Well, then, prove it.
Come on. If you want
some justification,
</p>

<p>
you're doing it
as a favor for me.
</p>

<p>
At least give me a chance
to bury the hatchet
with some style, huh?
</p>

<p>
You just don't drop your partner,
then turn down his invitation
all in one week, now do you?
</p>

<p>
Actually, the timing isn't bad.
I was just finishing the final chapter.
</p>

<p>
Ah, Mrs. Melville's last case.
</p>

<p>
You know, we ought to send
that broad some flowers.
</p>

<p>
Listen, I made a list of things
I'd like to take from the office.
</p>

<p>
You want to take
a look at it?
</p>

<p>
I don't get it.
It's a list of names.
Oh, I'm losing my mind.
</p>

<p>
It's the wrong one.
I must have left the other one
at the house.
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026; Oh, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt;
losing my mind.
</p>

<p>
What's the matter?
I left my lighter
in the office.
</p>

<p>
Do you need it?
That's my security blanket.
</p>

<p>
I'll only be a minute.
</p>

<p>
dd [Whistling]
</p>

<p>
And to think I had to
talk you into this trip.
</p>

<p>
Ah, Jim, smell that air.
How far is the cabin?
</p>

<p>
Ah, it's not far.
About an hour.
</p>

<p>
We have to skirt San Diego.
</p>

<p>
I'll only be a minute.
I just have to get some supplies.
</p>

<p>
Do you want to hand me that book
in that glove compartment?
</p>

<p>
Hey, it's one of ours.
[Chuckles]
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
The boss lady here's
a big fan of ours.
</p>

<p>
I've been promising this for months.
[Chuckles]
The price of fame.
</p>

<p>
You want me to come with you?
No, no.
I'll only be a minute.
</p>

<p>
Miss La Sanka!
</p>

<p>
Anybody home?
&lt;i&gt;In a minute!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Franklin!
</p>

<p>
Oh, my planets must be
in the right house!
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
Not only that,
but they're working overtime.
</p>

<p>
I have a surprise for you.
&lt;i&gt;Pour moi?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Pour moi.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Prescription: Murder.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
'A Mrs. Melville thriller&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
byJames Ferris
and Ken Franklin."
</p>

<p>
Oh, uh, take a look
at the first page.
</p>

<p>
You signed it?
You dear man.
</p>

<p>
Well, Mr. Franklin!
</p>

<p>
I'd rather have the storyteller
than the story.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'll tell you what.
</p>

<p>
If you play your cards right
and give me my grocery list,
someday you may have both.
</p>

<p>
Empty promises.
Miss La Sanka!
</p>

<p>
What do you need?
Just a few things
for overnight, thanks.
</p>

<p>
Who is it this week?
The blonde or the redhead?
Uh, Miss La Sanka,
</p>

<p>
I'm all alone this weekend.
</p>

<p>
Except for, uh, some
contemplation, some fishing
and a refreshment of my spirit.
</p>

<p>
Could you break this for me?
I need some change for the phone.
Thanks very much.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Cash Register Dings]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;That'll do fine.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Operator, I'd like to place
a station-to-station call
to Los Angeles.
</p>

<p>
The area code is 213.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Phone Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Hello.
Joanna, it's Ken.
</p>

<p>
Well, Ken! I thought
you werert talking to us.
</p>

<p>
Oh, that's all patched up.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact,
I leftJim at the office
a few hours ago.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We signed the armistice.</li>
<li>Oh, well, that's a relief.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Look, Joanna,
I wouldn't mention it to him.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure he'd like to
surprise you himself.
</p>

<p>
Uh, why don't you
join us for dinner?
We'll celebrate.
</p>

<p>
I'd really love to, but I'm&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'm spending the weekend
down here in San Diego
at the cabin.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact,
that's where I'm calling from.
</p>

<p>
All right. Then we'll
do it another time.
Absolutely.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Joanna, I thought maybe if you,
</p>

<p>
for some reason, needed to get
in touch with me, you do know
the number at the cabin.
</p>

<p>
Right.
I'll see you in a few days.
</p>

<p>
Fine.
</p>

<p>
Good-bye.
</p>

<p>
Did you ever get a feeling
of déjà vu?
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
Like you've, uh, done something before,
but you know you haven't.
</p>

<p>
Why?
What do you mean?
</p>

<p>
I'm getting it right now.
It's strange.
</p>

<p>
You know I've never
been here before.
</p>

<p>
Maybe in a previous
incarnation, huh?
</p>

<p>
Ken, it's fantastic.
The house
that Mrs. Melville built.
</p>

<p>
Wait till you see
the inside.
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
It's no wonder.
</p>

<p>
'No wonder" what?
</p>

<p>
What woman could resist
this setting?
</p>

<p>
Not very many.
I promise you that.
</p>

<p>
How about a drink, Jim?
More alcohol?
No, thanks.
</p>

<p>
It'll corrupt me.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
You're thinking
aboutJoanna, aren't you?
</p>

<p>
Well, yeah.
You know,
</p>

<p>
just taking off like that.
</p>

<p>
She still expects me for dinner.
We can fix that.
We'll put plan ' A" into effect.
</p>

<p>
Pick up the phone
and call her.
</p>

<p>
What am I gonna tell her?
The man is too square
for words.
</p>

<p>
Now, look. You simply say
that you're working
at the office.
</p>

<p>
You're calling from the office.
She knows you have a deadline to meet
with the book. You're working late.
</p>

<p>
How many times
have you had to do that?
A couple hundred, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Exactly.
That's why she'll believe you.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, well, I&#x2026;
I just hate lying
to her. You know.
</p>

<p>
You're not lying to her.
You're saving her
a little anguish.
</p>

<p>
Now, will you pick up the phone
and call her so we can
start enjoying ourselves?
</p>

<p>
Okay.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Oh, Operator, I'd like to</li>
</ul>
<p>
make a collect&#x2026;
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hold it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's a cinch you have never
cheated on Joanna before.
</p>

<p>
If you want your wife to believe
you're calling from the office,
</p>

<p>
you don't have the operator
place the call&#x2026; you dial it direct.
</p>

<p>
The area code is 213.
</p>

<p>
Hi, honey.
</p>

<p>
How are ya?
</p>

<p>
Well, that's what
I'm calling about.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Um, I'm at the office, and&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I'm pretty well into&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;this last chapter.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I'd like to work straight through.
Yeah, I know.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;L&#x2026; I know.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
This'll be the last time.
That I can&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Shot Fires]&lt;/i&gt;
Jimmy?
</p>

<p>
Jimmy!
</p>

<p>
Operator, get me the police.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Phone Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Hello. Joanna?
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
Joanna&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Will you take it easy?
Now, say it again once more.
</p>

<p>
Are you sure?
</p>

<p>
Did you call the police?
</p>

<p>
Yes, yes, of course.
I'll leave right away.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Joanna, please.
</p>

<p>
Take it easy.
</p>

<p>
And don't worry.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure it's nothing
but a practical joke.
</p>

<p>
Good-bye.
</p>

<p>
No, I know it's insane.
</p>

<p>
And l-l-I just&#x2026; I keep
thinking of the clichés and-and&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Jim and Ken
wrote this scene&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
in their books a hundred times.
</p>

<p>
Look at it this way, Mrs. Ferris.
Maybe he isn't dead.
</p>

<p>
Now, there's no body,
no blood&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
No! He was shot!
L-I know it!
</p>

<p>
L-l-I heard&#x2026;
I heard it on the phone.
</p>

<p>
Are you sure
it was a gunshot?
This place was searched.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Papers on the floor.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Have you any idea why?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&lt;i&gt;No, I have no idea why.&lt;/i&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Did you notice&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;anything special missing?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No, no, no.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Are you sure it was his voice?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Joanna]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Yes, I know it was his voice,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and maybe somebody&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Was he under any kind&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of extra pressure?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Joanna]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No. Maybe somebody was&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Did he say where he was calling from?</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
He said he was calling
from the office. He said&#x2026; He said&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;"I'm calling from the office."&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I really don't care&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;if anything was missing.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I just really want to find out&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;what happened to my husband.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
We'll do our best.
&lt;i&gt;You sure it was his voice?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I know it was his voice.&lt;/i&gt;
Are you sure it was a gunshot?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Yes, that's right.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Man] Would you like to sit down&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and get a glass of water?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yes, I would like&#x2026;
Really, please.
</p>

<p>
'Cause I really feel stupid,
</p>

<p>
and I just really
want to clear my head.
&lt;i&gt;Get the water.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Okay.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Columbo]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I think that's out of order, ma'am.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh, you see, that's the trouble
with these buildings.
The fountains never work.
</p>

<p>
Then you have to use
the coffee machine.
</p>

<p>
And then you lose your dime
and the coffee's lousy.
</p>

<p>
Who are you?
Uh, I'm just another cop.
</p>

<p>
My name's Columbo.
I'm a lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Were you in there&#x2026;
I got the proof right here.
</p>

<p>
You didn't see me in there
because I left before you got in there.
</p>

<p>
And you know why?
Because it's so smoky in there
and so noisy in there&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that I just had to come outside
and get a breath.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I think I'd better get back.
Now, look.
Wait a minute.
</p>

<p>
Let me tell you something.
You look very tired to me,
</p>

<p>
and I think you had
a terrible experience in there.
</p>

<p>
And I think
I ought to drive you home.
Let's call it a night.
</p>

<p>
Well, don't you think
they want to ask me questions?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I don't think they'll mind.
I think you've answered
enough questions,
</p>

<p>
and I'll call them
and I'll tell them you're with me.
</p>

<p>
Okay?
Well, what about Ken?
</p>

<p>
Why isn't Ken here?
</p>

<p>
I don't know why he isn't here.
</p>

<p>
Is that Mr. Franklin,
the other half of the writing team?
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Yeah, the other half
of the team.
</p>

<p>
You know, that's what I like
about these buttons.
</p>

<p>
You don't have to push 'em.
They go off with the heat
of your hand.
</p>

<p>
I bet you haven't had
anything to eat.
</p>

<p>
You're a very nice man, Lieutenant,
but I'm not really hungry.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you, Mrs. Ferris,
I'm the worst cook in the world.
</p>

<p>
But there's one thing I do terrific,
and that's an omelet.
</p>

<p>
Even my wife admits it.
Uh, I need something for the eggshells.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Over there in that cabinet.</li>
<li>Right.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm really not hungry.
&lt;i&gt;Listen.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You take a taste.
You don't like it,
</p>

<p>
you throw it away.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you what the secret is
to a good omelet.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No eggs. Just milk.</li>
<li>[Stifled Chuckle]</li>

<li>Uh, skillet.</li>
<li>Over there.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You're a very persuasive man,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I should hold up my end
and make the coffee.
</p>

<p>
I need cheese and onions
and, uh, butter.
</p>

<p>
Cheese&#x2026; Uh, I need something
to grate the cheese.
</p>

<p>
Over there in the cupboard.
</p>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
What did they do with him,
Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
I don't know, ma'am.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, there was no body in the office.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Couldn't that mean that he isn't dead?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, that's hard to say.
Uh, it's bothering me too.
</p>

<p>
I tell ya, the whole thing
doesn't make sense
unless it's a kidnapping.
</p>

<p>
Well, you don't shoot
a victim first, do you?
</p>

<p>
Why'd you laugh before?
When?
</p>

<p>
When I asked you if Mr. Franklin was
the other half of the writing team.
</p>

<p>
Did I laugh?
Yep.
</p>

<p>
Maybe it was the way you put it.
</p>

<p>
'Writing team."
</p>

<p>
Maybe I shouldn't say it,
</p>

<p>
but Ken hasn't written a word
of a Mrs. Melville novel in years.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Melville?
Who's Mrs. Melville?
</p>

<p>
The character
thatJim and Ken created.
</p>

<p>
The one who solves
all the crimes brilliantly.
</p>

<p>
Well, uh, why did your husband
put up with it?
</p>

<p>
What I mean is, uh,
him doing all the work.
</p>

<p>
Well, there were compensations.
</p>

<p>
Ken did the publicity,
went on all the talk shows,
</p>

<p>
and he did interviews
and cultivated the film people.
</p>

<p>
He contributed.
</p>

<p>
He just didn't do
any of the writing.
</p>

<p>
Boy, I'll tell ya,
I'd love to be a writer.
</p>

<p>
That's a terrific talent.
</p>

<p>
Where did he get
all the ideas?
</p>

<p>
Oh, from almost anything.
</p>

<p>
People. Magazines.
</p>

<p>
Conversations.
</p>

<p>
I'm constantly finding
scraps of paper
and old matchbook covers&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
just all over the house
with notes and ideas.
</p>

<p>
And those were mysteries, too,
werert they, huh?
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm.
They're tricky.
I'll tell you that.
</p>

<p>
I could never
figure those things out.
</p>

<p>
Well, it got harder.
</p>

<p>
Maybe that's why he decided
to go out on his own.
</p>

<p>
Oh, really? I didn't know that.
I guess he wanted to do
some serious work.
</p>

<p>
No kidding?
</p>

<p>
How did Mr. Franklin take that?
</p>

<p>
Not very well.
</p>

<p>
But he'll get over it.
</p>

<p>
Gee, I'd hate to be in his shoes.
Why?
</p>

<p>
Well, you got a writing team, and they're
very famous, and now they break up,
and what happens?
</p>

<p>
One fella continues writing books,
and the other fella just stops.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. That's what
I keep telling Jim&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that sooner or later,
people are bound to find out.
</p>

<p>
What, that your husband
did all the writing?
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Kind of tough
on Mr. Franklirs ego.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Doorbell Rings]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, Ken!
Jo.
</p>

<p>
I know, I know.
Just take it easy.
</p>

<p>
I drove up here
as fast as I could.
</p>

<p>
Is there anything new?
No, not yet.
</p>

<p>
Jo, it's incredible.
</p>

<p>
I just saw him
this morning at the office.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm sorry, Ken.
Uh,
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Columbo,
Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
How you doir?
No, the question is,
how you doing, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm afraid
we just got started.
</p>

<p>
Has Jim been found yet?
</p>

<p>
Has he been found yet?
Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Why? Did somebody tell you
he was gone?
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I just spent several hours
driving up here from San Diego.
</p>

<p>
You must know that this story
is on every news station.
</p>

<p>
Oh, right. Yeah.
Gee, I should have thought of that.
</p>

<p>
Well, has he been found?
Gee, I'm afraid not.
</p>

<p>
No. Were you visiting friends
in San Diego?
</p>

<p>
He has a place there&#x2026; a cabin.
Oh, away for the weekend.
Gee, that's nice.
</p>

<p>
Mmm. Could we get back
to my question?
</p>

<p>
Have you come up with
any leads, any clues?
</p>

<p>
Uh, it's a little early for that.
&lt;i&gt;Early?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Seems to me your men are
standing around just marking time.
</p>

<p>
Could I have a drink, love?
</p>

<p>
I could use one myself.
Thanks.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you something,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;See, if Mrs. Melville&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;were on this case,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
oh, she'd be leaps and bounds
ahead of you by now.
</p>

<p>
Is that the lady in the books?
&lt;i&gt;That's right.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You see, she would have
figured out that this is not
just someone missing.
</p>

<p>
This is a professional killing.
</p>

<p>
Aha. Here it is.
</p>

<p>
Take a look at that.
Uh, put it on the desk.
</p>

<p>
Just drop it. 'Cause of
the fingerprints, you know.
</p>

<p>
Jim's fingerprints
are all over that.
So are mine.
</p>

<p>
What is it?
What's it look like?
It's a list of names.
</p>

<p>
Look at that. Mustel,
Delgado, Hathaway, Westlake&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Sound familiar?
Uh, yeah, kinda.
</p>

<p>
Well, they should. That's a list
of some of the top men
in organized crime on the West Coast&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
L.A., Vegas, Frisco&#x2026;
I don't understand.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's painfully obvious.
</p>

<p>
One of these men
had Jim killed.
</p>

<p>
Really? Why?
</p>

<p>
Tell me something.
How long have you been
a lieutenant, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Melville would have
put that together like that.
[Snaps Fingers]
</p>

<p>
Look, I&#x2026; I'm willing to take
all the help I can get.
</p>

<p>
All right. Let me see
if I can explain it to you.
</p>

<p>
See, my partner and I
decided to split,
go our separate ways.
</p>

<p>
I'm sureJoanna must have
mentioned that to you.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, she said
something about that.
</p>

<p>
Did she also mention the fact
thatJim wanted to do
some serious writing?
</p>

<p>
Hey.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
</p>

<p>
Wait a minute. Yeah!
Dawning on you now?
I knew you'd get it.
</p>

<p>
But that's only
the tip of the iceberg.
</p>

<p>
You see, Jim was researching
a complete and factual exposé&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
of all West Coast organized crime.
</p>

<p>
I mean, he was going around asking
some pretty embarrassing questions.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Probing.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Compiling dossiers.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;That's why&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;they searched this office.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Apparently, they got everything
but that list.
</p>

<p>
And you think one of these fellas
put out a contract on him.
</p>

<p>
Of course. Word must have gotten around
thatJim was compiling all this information.
</p>

<p>
They knew they couldn't buy him off,
so what do they do?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;They chose the usual&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;alternative.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Professional killing, huh?
But if that's true,
why did they get rid of the body?
</p>

<p>
Well, who knows?
But remember one thing&#x2026;
Without a corpus delicti,
</p>

<p>
you can't prove a murder
was committed in the first place.
</p>

<p>
But why would
a professional killer care?
</p>

<p>
I mean, he's already on a plane
back from where he came.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I can't answer
all your questions. I've given you
a list of the most likely suspects.
</p>

<p>
A clear motive.
Isn't that enough to start with?
</p>

<p>
Oh, that's plenty.
And believe me, I'm very grateful
for all the help you've given me.
</p>

<p>
Gee, that's funny.
What?
</p>

<p>
Well, this thing is folded lengthwise,
like someone was carrying it
in their pocket.
</p>

<p>
So?
</p>

<p>
Well, if he typed that
on that typewriter&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and I'll run a check on that&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
why would he fold it up
before he put it in that drawer?
</p>

<p>
[Chuckling]
I'm beginning to like you.
</p>

<p>
Why is that?
Because you're finally beginning
to think like Mrs. Melville.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Jim used to
fold up a piece of paper,
</p>

<p>
and he'd use it
as a bookmark, you know.
Ah.
</p>

<p>
Now, however interesting
your observation is,
</p>

<p>
it only leads us far astray.
</p>

<p>
However,
since you are beginning to learn
how to emulate our dear lady,
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna give you something
that you richly deserve&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
a chance to read
some of our books.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's very nice of you.
Didn't expect gifts tonight, huh?
</p>

<p>
Thank you. Maybe I can
pick up a few pointers.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm sure you can.
</p>

<p>
Uh, could you handle
some more?
Oh, all right.
</p>

<p>
Here you go.
Oh, and an extra.
Oh, that's very nice.
</p>

<p>
That ought to keep you busy
for a while, huh?
Yeah, it sure will.
</p>

<p>
Well, anything else, Lieutenant?
Uh, no, I don't think so.
</p>

<p>
I think I'd better let you
get some sleep.
Oh, that's very nice of you.
</p>

<p>
I just only hope
I was of some help.
Oh, you certainly were.
</p>

<p>
Well, good night, Lieutenant.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mr. Franklin. Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Actually, uh, there is one thing,
</p>

<p>
not that it makes
that much difference.
</p>

<p>
What is it?
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Ferris called you
and told you her husband got shot,
</p>

<p>
you jumped in a car and drove
right back to L.A.
</p>

<p>
Is that right?
That's right.
</p>

<p>
You know, me,
I'd have taken a plane.
</p>

<p>
I mean, it's a big airport,
and they run every half hour.
It'd been a lot faster.
</p>

<p>
Well, I&#x2026; That's true,
but in a situation like that,
who thinks clearly?
</p>

<p>
And look at it this way.
You add up all the time it takes
to drive to and from an airport,
</p>

<p>
how much time
do you really save?
</p>

<p>
Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Operator, would you get me
the police, please?
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Lt. Columbo, please.
</p>

<p>
Yes, thank you.
I'll wait.
</p>

<p>
Columbo, this is Franklin.
</p>

<p>
I think you better get over here
right away.
</p>

<p>
937 Skyview Drive.
</p>

<p>
It's an emergency.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Woman On Police Radio: Indistinct]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Woman on Radio]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;1- L 10. MPs have been notified.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Do you still request&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a radio unit?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man On Radio]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;All units in the vicinity,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;a prowler, 12F3&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Fades]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
When I got home, there he&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
there it was, right
in the middle of the lawn.
</p>

<p>
Terrible thing to come home to.
</p>

<p>
The funny thing is, I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I kept hoping or I&#x2026;
I was sure thatJim was still alive.
</p>

<p>
PoorJoanna.
</p>

<p>
Every time I think of
feeling sorry for myself,
</p>

<p>
I think of how much
&lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; had to lose.
</p>

<p>
Look at 'em!
</p>

<p>
Vultures!
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, you mind
if I go inside? I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
can't stand
to watch them&#x2026; gape.
</p>

<p>
Listen. You mind
if I come with you?
</p>

<p>
Because there's no lining
in this coat, and I'm a bit chilly.
</p>

<p>
I don't mind.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Phone Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Hello.
</p>

<p>
Yes, this is Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
What? No comment.
</p>

<p>
Aw, you've gotta be kidding.
You want an interview now?
</p>

<p>
A gentleman of the press.
&lt;i&gt;Afraid you're gonna get&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a lot of that.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I'm forgetting my manners.
Would you like a drink?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Yeah. Mmm.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Maybe a drop ofbourbon.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Bourbon.
</p>

<p>
Boy, this is quite a place.
</p>

<p>
This a copy?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Hardly.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It's an original.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Gee, I thought they only
hung this stuff on museums.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You own this?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Melville has been very kind.
</p>

<p>
Boy. Quite a place.
</p>

<p>
Gee whiz. And you got
that other place in San Diego.
</p>

<p>
Gee, the upkeep alone must be&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I manage to scrape by.
Your drink.
</p>

<p>
Thank you. You know,
there's one thing about writers
that I don't understand.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you can help me
clear it up.
</p>

<p>
If a fella's partner dies,
</p>

<p>
uh, does he own the other
fella's half of the books,
half of the, uh, um&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Royalties?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
No. They go
into the deceased's estate.
</p>

<p>
Mmm. That leaves you
out in the cold, doesn't it?
</p>

<p>
Unless, of course,
you insured each other.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, aren't we going
a bit far astray?
</p>

<p>
You're right. We shouldn't
be talking about this now.
</p>

<p>
It's not the time.
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026; Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
So, Mr. Franklin, tell me, uh,
</p>

<p>
why do you think that they left
your partner's body out there
on the lawn like that?
</p>

<p>
Do you mean to tell me
you haven't figured that out?
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
you disappoint me.
</p>

<p>
It was left as a warning.
A warning?
</p>

<p>
Of course.
</p>

<p>
It also proves my theory about
it being a professional killing.
</p>

<p>
See, the moment they dropped
Jim's body in the middle
of that lawn&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Please, sit down.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You know&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;what they were saying?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
That this could happen to you&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
unless you stop
in your partner's research.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They're trying to scare you.</li>
<li>Exactly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
So what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna continue
writing the book anyway?
</p>

<p>
No, that's the irony of it.
You see, that was Jim's
pet project, not mine.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.
</p>

<p>
Say, I guess they didn't have
any way of knowing
you two were gonna split up.
</p>

<p>
Nah. Even if they did,
it wouldn't have doneJim any good.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I must say, Lieutenant,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you're up against a dead end.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Look at this.
You got a body,
</p>

<p>
you got a motive,
</p>

<p>
but you're never
gonna find that killer.
</p>

<p>
It's not gonna be easy.
</p>

<p>
I'll lay you 5 to &lt;i&gt;1
it was someone
in Las Vegas or Miami.
</p>

<p>
Picked up a phone and&#x2026;
pfft! &#x2026;put out a contract.
Right. Right.
</p>

<p>
How you're gonna make a case,
much less solve one,
is beyond me.
</p>

<p>
I know. I guess the only thing
I can do is&#x2026; just check out
every name on that list.
</p>

<p>
Sure. You know what's gonna
happen? Every one of those guys
is gonna deny thatJim even existed.
</p>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
I must say
I don't envy you.
I don't envy myself.
</p>

<p>
Now, look. I got a lot
of phone calls to make.
I'd better get on it, huh?
</p>

<p>
All the luck.
Thanks. Thanks a lot,
Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
And listen. I'm very sorry
about what happened tonight.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
Right.
</p>

<p>
You, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You will keep me posted,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant?&lt;/i&gt;
Oh, yes, I will. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
You know, there's only one thing
that I'm not clear about.
</p>

<p>
But that can wait.
You want to go to bed.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I'm not gonna
get any sleep anyway.
What is it?
</p>

<p>
Would you go over for me
once again&#x2026; I know you did it&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
exactly what happened
when you came home tonight?
</p>

<p>
Sure. L&#x2026;
I've already told you, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
The moment I saw Jim's body
in the middle of the lawn,
</p>

<p>
I came running in here
and I picked up the phone
and I called you.
</p>

<p>
I mean, it's a purely
reflexive action.
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh.
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh. That's fine.
Now, wait a minute.
You look like you're troubled.
</p>

<p>
Is there some reason
for your question?
</p>

<p>
Uh, it's your mail.
</p>

<p>
My mail?
Isn't it funny
how people are different?
</p>

<p>
Now, me, if I found my partner dead,
I'd never think of opening my letters.
</p>

<p>
But I-I&#x2026; I just did it
to distract myself.
</p>

<p>
I mean, you got to remember
one thing, that's a great shock.
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
Oh, that's understandable.
</p>

<p>
And bills are distracting.
Listen, if anything comes up,
</p>

<p>
I'll call you right away.
</p>

<p>
Good night.
Good night.
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna have a hot dog.
I guess I will too.
</p>

<p>
No, no, Mr. Tucker.
You put that away.
</p>

<p>
This one's on me.
</p>

<p>
May I have a receipt, please?
</p>

<p>
All right, Lieutenant.
You're bribing me
with a handsome lunch.
</p>

<p>
What can I do for you?
Uh, this is about
an insurance policy.
</p>

<p>
Oh, excellent.
It's about time you came to me.
</p>

<p>
I can give you
a package within your&#x2026;
Yeah, this is, uh,
</p>

<p>
an insurance policy
that was already written.
</p>

<p>
Oh, this is official business.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, there are two mystery writers&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Ken Franklin and James Ferris.
</p>

<p>
Your company
wrote a policy on them?
Now, wait a minute, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
We like to cooperate
with the police, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
if you want confidential information,
I'm afraid that you&#x2026;
Oh, well, look, uh,
</p>

<p>
I don't want to cause you any trouble.
</p>

<p>
Maybe it'll be more helpful
if I got a court order?
</p>

<p>
[Chattering]
</p>

<p>
[Chattering Continues]
</p>

<p>
Oh, Ken, it was simply marvelous.
I was terrified.
</p>

<p>
Oh, really?
I had the whole thing figured out
by the end of the first act.
</p>

<p>
Oh, you did?
I was completely fooled.
</p>

<p>
You must have a devious mind.
No, dear,
it's because you're young.
</p>

<p>
Always remember
one thing, my love.
</p>

<p>
The moment
a man mentions a long-lost twin,
</p>

<p>
you can inevitably know that it's
going to be some impersonation.
</p>

<p>
It's an old plot trick.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Franklin! Yoo-hoo!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Over here!</li>
<li>Who's that?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Someone
that should be somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No, we go this way.&lt;/i&gt;
Excuse me a moment.
</p>

<p>
Miss La Sanka,
what a pleasant surprise.
Hi. [Giggling]
</p>

<p>
What brings you to the big city?
Oh, I came in to do
a little shopping.
</p>

<p>
You&#x2026; You like my dress?
Oh, it's lovely.
</p>

<p>
See a play.
[Laughs]
</p>

<p>
She's a beauty,
Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Yes, she is.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Uh, thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I haven't seen her before
have I?
</p>

<p>
No, I don't believe you have.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's&#x2026;
it's lovely to see you.
I, uh,
</p>

<p>
hope you won't think
I'm being forward,
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
But is there any chance of, uh,
our having a drink together?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'd&#x2026; I'd love to, really.
But, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
See, the young lady and I
are going to have a late supper.
</p>

<p>
I think you might want to cancel it.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Just why would I want to do that?</li>
<li>Because&#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
we really should have a discussion.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Perhaps some other time.
All right. L&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I suppose I'll have to find
someone else to tell my story to.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
It's a mystery story.
</p>

<p>
Very interesting.
Really.
</p>

<p>
It's all about this witness.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Just wait here.
I'll be right back.
</p>

<p>
Anything you say, Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
d &lt;i&gt;[Piano]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
Oh, wow!
</p>

<p>
Oh, I just can't resist
strawberries.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm glad you like them.
</p>

<p>
[Giggling]
</p>

<p>
[Giggling Continues]
You're&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
You're making me nervous.
</p>

<p>
That's quite a stare.
I'm sorry.
L-I can't help it.
</p>

<p>
You know,
I've never seen you outside
that store before.
</p>

<p>
You're very lovely.
</p>

<p>
May I call you Lili?
Yes, please do.
[Giggles]
</p>

<p>
How did you enjoy
the play tonight?
Oh, I thought
it was predictable. You?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I like your books
much more.
That's very flattering.
</p>

<p>
But you said something before
about, uh,
</p>

<p>
about your story
or something about a&#x2026;
a witness.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes. Well, actually,
</p>

<p>
it's a, uh,
true-to-life story.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the best kind.
[Giggles]
</p>

<p>
It concerns your partner.
Jim?
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh.
What about him?
</p>

<p>
Well, I read in the papers
about his death,
</p>

<p>
and I felt just terrible.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
I felt just terrible, because they said
he was killed in his office.
</p>

<p>
So they did.
Well,
</p>

<p>
in my story, you see,
</p>

<p>
he couldn't have actually
been killed in an office,
</p>

<p>
because he was, uh,
</p>

<p>
somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
Just for a moment,
let's forget about your story,
</p>

<p>
and let's, uh&#x2026;
let's talk about real life.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
It is simpler, isn't it?
Much.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you honestly, Ken.
</p>

<p>
I was very confused
when I saw the papers,
because,
</p>

<p>
when you were in my store
making a phone call the other day,
Uh-huh.
</p>

<p>
I wandered over
to the side window to see&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
if you had brought a lady with you.
[Giggles]
</p>

<p>
You didn't believe me when I said
that I was alone.
Oh, I believed you.
It's just that&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'm very interested in you, Ken.
</p>

<p>
[Giggles]
Well, anyway,
</p>

<p>
you can imagine my surprise
when I saw your partner.
</p>

<p>
There he was, big as life,
</p>

<p>
sitting there
in the front seat of your car.
</p>

<p>
And that disturbed you, huh?
Oh, not at that time.
</p>

<p>
Only later.
</p>

<p>
And then I debated
with myself for days&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
whether to come
and see you or not.
</p>

<p>
Why didn't you go to the police?
Oh, Ken.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't want
to get you into trouble.
[Giggling]
</p>

<p>
Of course not.
[Snorting Chuckle]
All right, Lili. How much?
</p>

<p>
[Laughs]
I hope you don't think that
that's the on&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't think anything.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you something.
I'm most grateful you came to me first.
</p>

<p>
Know why?
Because I think we can reach
an equitable agreement.
</p>

<p>
I do so admire your candor.
</p>

<p>
This isn't easy for me&#x2026;
a widow running a&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
small country store,
trying to make ends meet.
Oh, I can understand that.
</p>

<p>
And I also recognize in you
a woman of&#x2026; of some breeding.
</p>

<p>
I mean, you're not just
a common&#x2026; blackmailer.
</p>

<p>
I'm so glad you're understanding.
</p>

<p>
Very well, Lili.
</p>

<p>
How much for your silence?
</p>

<p>
$15,000? L&#x2026;
&lt;i&gt;[Plate Clattering]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh! L-I know it's a lot,
but that's all I'll ever ask for.
Honestly.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>And I'm a woman of my word!</li>
<li>I know you are, and I respect you for that.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And you know what?
</p>

<p>
In that spirit, I accept your terms.
Agreed?
</p>

<p>
[Relieved Chuckle]
Agreed.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
And I know you won't take offense
when I say,
</p>

<p>
'It's a pleasure
doing business with you."
</p>

<p>
No, no. My pleasure.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
[Both Chuckling]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>[Chuckling Continues]</li>
<li>&lt;i&gt;[Doorbell Chiming]&lt;/i&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yes?
Is Mr. Franklin home?
</p>

<p>
He's occupied at the moment.
Who shall I say is calling?
</p>

<p>
Uh, Lt. Columbo.
Oh. Well, won't you
come in and wait?
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
He'll be with you shortly.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Camera Shutter Clicking]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Man]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Only a few more.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Thanks muchly, Mr. Franklin.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I think we're about finished,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
if you can bear
one or two more photographs.
&lt;i&gt;Fire away.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
After all, your magazine
was very kind to Franklin and Ferris
during our lean years.
</p>

<p>
That's, uh, the second reason
I granted the interview.
Oh? What was the first?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why, the charm</li>
</ul>
<p>
of the interviewer, of course.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thank you.</li>

<li>&lt;i&gt;[Thump]&lt;/i&gt;</li>
<li>[Shutter Clicks]</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yes, Lieutenant.
Is there something I can do for you?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah. If-lf you&#x2026;
If you have a moment.
</p>

<p>
That's about all I do have.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I finish here,
I'll be right with you.
</p>

<p>
Is there anything else, Miss, uh&#x2026;
May I call you Gloria?
Please do.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Uh, just one last question.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I think our readers will want to know
how the death of your partner will affect
the Mrs. Melville books.
</p>

<p>
I'm afraid when I buried Jim
I buried Mrs. Melville with him.
</p>

<p>
Mmm, I understand.
</p>

<p>
But everyone will miss her so.
Can't you write another one?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I could, naturally,
but what's the point?
</p>

<p>
With Jim gone, there&#x2026;
[Smacks Lips]
Wouldn't be much reason.
</p>

<p>
No, I'm afraid, uh,
Mrs. Melville has solved
her last case.
</p>

<p>
Actually, I've been&#x2026;
seriously debating as to whether
I would ever want to write again.
</p>

<p>
Oh, well, I hope you do.
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you don't mind, huh?
Of course.
Let's go Harvey.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps,
under better circumstances,
I, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
less harassed circumstances&#x2026;
I could give you a more detailed interview.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Even in more depth.</li>
<li>&lt;i&gt;Mmm, that'll be nice.&lt;/i&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>
Shall I call you?
Yes. Please do.
Next week, huh?
</p>

<p>
Good-bye.
</p>

<p>
Oh, sorry, Harvey.
Thanks, very much.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
All right, Lieutenant.
What can I do for you?
</p>

<p>
Well, I brought back your books.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, that's fine.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Just put 'em over there&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;on the table.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Uh, sure.
I wanted to tell ya how much
I enjoyed 'em.
</p>

<p>
I think they're the most terrific&#x2026;
Boy, I wanna&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
And&#x2026; Oh, listen, I'll come back.
I'll make two trips on this.
</p>

<p>
But the&#x2026; the lady detective&#x2026;
What a character, what a brain.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And what logic!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The way she figures it out!&lt;/i&gt;
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
I'd love to sit down
and discuss literature with you,
but I was on my way out.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
</p>

<p>
I didn't mean to bother ya.
Uh, you goir someplace special?
</p>

<p>
Yes, as a matter of fact.
I'm on my way down to my cabin
for a rest.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Would you like an itinerary?</li>
<li>Hey, I'm sorry.</li>

<li>I'm makir a pest of myself.</li>
<li>No.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yes, yes, I am.
I know, it's because I keep
askir these questions.
</p>

<p>
But I'll tell ya.
I can't help myself.
</p>

<p>
It's a habit.
I take it you're not goir alone.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Whatever gave that idea?</li>
<li>I noticed the two bottles of champagne.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oh, those. Oh, I'm quite capable
of drinking those two bottles&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and a good deal more
without any help.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Uh, listen.
Unless you just wanna take a second&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
to know how we're progressir
on your partner's list.
</p>

<p>
Oh?
Anything concrete?
</p>

<p>
No, not a thing.
Just like you predicted.
</p>

<p>
Everyone said
they never even heard ofJames Ferris.
</p>

<p>
[Smacks Lips]
That's just as I expected.
</p>

<p>
Well, it was lovely to chat with you,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mr. Franklin?
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Is it important?
Well, it could be.
You see, I was checking the, uh,
</p>

<p>
the phone company records
in San Diego.
</p>

<p>
Now, why would you want
to do that, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Oh, well, I have to do that.
You know, that's part of my job.
I got to tie up all those loose ends.
</p>

<p>
Anyway,
on the day of the murder&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
there was a record
of a call from the cabin.
</p>

<p>
It was a call to the Ferris house
in Los Angeles.
</p>

<p>
I see.
And now you're wondering whether
I can explain that. Is that right?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm sure you can.
Oh, you're right. I can.
</p>

<p>
But, you see, you would've saved
both you and me a great deal of trouble&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
if you'd checked
with Joanna Ferris first.
</p>

<p>
She would've explained to you
that I'd spoken with her from my cabin,
</p>

<p>
telling her thatJim and I had
patched up our differences.
</p>

<p>
Oh, what do you mean
by ' differences"? Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Well, you see,
ironing out any difficulties
in a separation is never easy.
</p>

<p>
And I knew Joanna would be concerned,
and I wanted to put her mind at ease.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I see.
Can you understand that?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes. Yeah, that's understandable.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh, fine. Is that all?
</p>

<p>
Yes, that's all. Right.
Good.
</p>

<p>
[Snickers]
Listen, uh,
enjoy your trip.
</p>

<p>
Thanks very much.
</p>

<p>
And drive carefully.
[Engine Starts]
</p>

<p>
Don't worry, Lieutenant.
You can count on it.
</p>

<p>
And&#x2026; here you are!
[Laughs]
</p>

<p>
Bearing gifts.
</p>

<p>
And more gifts.
Why, Mr. Franklin, how lovely.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Ken.
Yes, of course. Ken.
</p>

<p>
Now, Lili, let me ask
you a simple question.
</p>

<p>
You up to making a nice,
quiet dinner for two tonight?
</p>

<p>
d &lt;i&gt;[Orchestra: Romantic]&lt;/i&gt;
Here's to&#x2026; prosperity.
</p>

<p>
And romance.
</p>

<p>
[Both Chuckling]
</p>

<p>
A daily double.
&lt;i&gt;[Laughing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, I must say, Lili,
that was a magnificent meal.
</p>

<p>
Where'd you learn
to cook so well?
</p>

<p>
My late husband,
may he rest in peace,
</p>

<p>
was a professional chef.
</p>

<p>
Wonderful man.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
He taught me all I know.
Well, he taught you well.
</p>

<p>
Thank you, sir.
</p>

<p>
Refill?
Oh, sorry.
</p>

<p>
Oop!
We're all out.
[Laughs]
</p>

<p>
Let's open another one.
Dare we?
</p>

<p>
Dare we not?
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm!
</p>

<p>
Here we go. Happy New Year!
[Cork Pops]
</p>

<p>
[Both Laughing]
Quick, the glass.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing Continues]
</p>

<p>
Oh! Mmm!
</p>

<p>
Delicious!
</p>

<p>
But I'm afraid
I'm getting a little tipsy.
</p>

<p>
What's wrong with that?
</p>

<p>
[Slurred]
I don't know if I can trust you.
</p>

<p>
Now,
is there any reason not to?
</p>

<p>
Lili, if I make you uncomfortable,
I can always leave.
</p>

<p>
No. Please.
I do enjoy your company.
</p>

<p>
You know what we should do?
What?
</p>

<p>
It's such a beautiful night,
we should&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
row out
to the center of the lake and&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
go for a swim.
Mmm.
Sounds nice.
</p>

<p>
Mmm. Is nice. Shall we?
</p>

<p>
Better not.
Why not?
</p>

<p>
I trust you, Ken.
Really.
</p>

<p>
But we all have
our dark sides, don't we?
</p>

<p>
Just wouldn't be very intelligent of me
to be alone with you in a small boat.
</p>

<p>
After all, you might start having
second thoughts about the money.
</p>

<p>
I wish
you hadrt said that, Lili.
</p>

<p>
That kind of talk
hurts me deeply.
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna tell you something,
and I shouldn't.
</p>

<p>
But I'll tell you why,
because I trust you.
</p>

<p>
I was prepared to give you
considerably more than you asked for.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen thousand&#x2026; I mean,
I've lost that much gambling
in one night.
</p>

<p>
Well, it certainly
is a great deal of money to me.
</p>

<p>
What do you think you'll, uh&#x2026;
you'll do with all of it?
</p>

<p>
I don't know.
Put it in the bank, I guess.
</p>

<p>
But not right away.
</p>

<p>
Ohh!
I just want to look at it for awhile.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
d &lt;i&gt;[Continues]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Better be careful.
</p>

<p>
Someone might, uh,
rob you.
</p>

<p>
I'll just keep it for a day or two.
</p>

<p>
I've never seen
so much money in my life.
</p>

<p>
Uh,
</p>

<p>
maybe&#x2026;
maybe you could take a&#x2026;
a trip somewhere, huh?
</p>

<p>
I may. I've always
wanted to go on a cruise.
</p>

<p>
Oh, cruises,
they're so romantic.
</p>

<p>
Did I tell you that my late husband
was in the merchant marines?
</p>

<p>
Is that a fact?
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
They're the ones
who taught him how to cook.
</p>

<p>
I almost wish he were here now.
</p>

<p>
He could share this with me.
</p>

<p>
Or maybe we can do
the next best thing.
</p>

<p>
[No Audio]
</p>

<p>
Who did you say it is?
One of the cops said
it was a local woman.
</p>

<p>
Some kind of drowning.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Woman On Police Radio]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Twelve A-15, clear.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Twelve A-17, are you clear?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Twelve A-1, clear.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Twelve A-15, stand by.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;One L-10, M.P. S have been notified.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
dd [Whistling]
</p>

<p>
dd [Stops]
</p>

<p>
Mornir!
</p>

<p>
Well, Lt. Columbo.
I must say, you turn up
at the oddest times, don't you?
</p>

<p>
Listen, I hope you don't mind
my comir in that way, you know.
</p>

<p>
But the door was open,
and I just let myself in.
Oh, no.
</p>

<p>
How'd you get here? By magic carpet?
I didn't see your car outside.
</p>

<p>
Oh, no. I pulled around back,
and I put it in the shade.
</p>

<p>
You know,
the sun raises hell with the paint.
Oh, sensible.
</p>

<p>
Well, what brings you
up here to the wilds?
</p>

<p>
Well, I'll tell ya.
I heard you and Mrs. Ferris talk
so much about this place,
</p>

<p>
and you made it sound so terrific,
and believe me, uh,
</p>

<p>
you werert exaggerating,
because&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
this is magnificent.
</p>

<p>
And, uh, since I got
a two-week vacation comir up,
</p>

<p>
I said to myself, ' Go on down there,
check out the area, look to see.
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you can rent a cabin."
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, you're not gonna tell me
you drove down here just to look
for a vacation spot, are you?
</p>

<p>
Why else would I come?
You're wasting your time.
</p>

<p>
I have a feeling that cabins
in this neck of the woods are pretty much
out of your price range, anyway.
</p>

<p>
Most of them are&#x2026;
are rented for the season.
</p>

<p>
Oh, gee whiz, that's&#x2026;
that's too bad.
</p>

<p>
Gosh, my wife
is gonna be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
Well, it was a nice ride, anyhow.
Yes, a lovely drive.
</p>

<p>
Except for that
bottleneck down the road.
What was that all about?
</p>

<p>
Oh, there was a drowning.
&lt;i&gt;Well, what was it,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a fisherman?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, I heard someone say
it was a local woman.
</p>

<p>
Uh, a Miss La Sanka
or something like that?
Something like that, yeah.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Did you know her?
Not really, no.
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering, because,
when I was in the kitchen before,
</p>

<p>
I noticed a grocery box
with her name on it.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I occasionally buy supplies
there, sure, like anyone else
who lives around here.
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh.
I think she was the one
that drowned. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
'Cause I, uh, stopped by
the grocery store on the way here
to pick up some cigars,
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;and I noticed it was closed&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and the cops'cars around.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, if it was her,
I&#x2026; I'd be very sorry.
</p>

<p>
She was always very friendly.
Yeah, that's a shame.
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm.
[Sucks Teeth]
Oh, you &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; know her.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I know a lot of people
without really knowing them.
</p>

<p>
You know, like barbers,
waitresses, parking lot attendants,
</p>

<p>
even the cop on the beat.
</p>

<p>
Don't you?
Yeah. [Chuckling]
Yeah, I do, matter of fact.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you, though.
People are strange.
</p>

<p>
You know, I can't figure 'em out.
Why a woman goes out on a lake
all by herself&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
before the light comes up.
Oh, there's nothing
unusual about that.
</p>

<p>
A lot of us go out early.
</p>

<p>
It's peaceful
and kind of makes
you feel like you're&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
plugged into nature.
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
Know what I mean?
Yeah. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Well, say, listen.
Look, you came down here&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
to get away from things,
and I'm just takir up your time.
</p>

<p>
I didn't mean to bother you.
No, no, no.
It's no bother at all.
</p>

<p>
Say, I'd be more than glad
to let you have a bathing suit,
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;but, uh, you don't look like&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the athletic type to me.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, it's, uh, my wife
that's the athlete.
</p>

<p>
Oh?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
So, you don't think I'm gonna
be able to find a cabin to rent, huh?
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
Best bet is to go down and check
with some of the local real estate people.
Uh-huh.
</p>

<p>
Because I think it'd be fun
to be neighbors for a couple of weeks.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
[Laughs] Y-Yeah.
Say, what kind of nightlife
do you have around here?
</p>

<p>
Nightlife? None.
</p>

<p>
No partying?
Just sleep and crickets.
</p>

<p>
Gee, I was just wonderir,
because,
</p>

<p>
you know, I didn't want
to barge in on you today
unannounced.
</p>

<p>
I don't follow you.
No, last night I called
to tell ya that I was comir.
</p>

<p>
But there was no one at home.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Woman On Police Radio,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Indistinct]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Uh, you a reporter?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh, no, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Uh, Lieutenant, uh,
Columbo,
</p>

<p>
uh, police.
</p>

<p>
L.A. Unit.
All right.
</p>

<p>
L.A.P.D.
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
What brings you down here,
Lieutenant?
Well, I'm workir on a case.
</p>

<p>
Uh, listen,
this is not really my jurisdiction,
</p>

<p>
but do&#x2026;
do ya mind if I browse around?
</p>

<p>
Well, help yourself, Lieutenant.
Always glad to cooperate.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Didn't she have a bruise on her head?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man] How'd you know that, Ben?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, come on, Sergeant.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Doc Webster told us.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;All right, so there was a bruise.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Probably as a result of the boat capsizing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and rendering her unconscious.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Any indication the lady
was under the influence?
</p>

<p>
I can't ascertain that
until we see an autopsy report.
</p>

<p>
The doctor's
working on that right now.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #1]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Sounds like drinkirto me.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #2] Could she swim?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Sergeant] How would I know&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a thing like that?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I wasn't married to the lady.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #3] Any living relatives?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I don't think so.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Somebody said she was a widow.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #3]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How about the rowboat?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Rowboat? What about it?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, who'd it belong to?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where'd it come from?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It belonged to the deceased.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I've got witnesses that have seen her&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;take it out on the lake.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Voices Continue, Indistinct]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #1]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Think she wanted&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;some fresh air last night?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Sergeant]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This is all conjecture, gentlemen.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I mean, there's no way of telling.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Maybe she did.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Who knows?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It's also possible&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that she had a heart seizure&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;or she got dizzy.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #3]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Then you think it was an accident.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I certainly don't think it was foul play.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You gonna be in your office&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;this afternoon?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Sergeant] Absolutely.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #1]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How long was she in the water, Sergeant?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, I don't know.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Wait'll we get the report.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We're startirto cover the same&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;old ground here, gentlemen.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Now, why don't you meet me&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in my office an hour from now.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, we've got some&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;more questions here we'd like&lt;/i&gt; to&#x2026;
&lt;i&gt;I'll answer 'em all then.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I'll have the reports, and I'll be able&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to give a lot more information. Okay?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Okay, Sarge, thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Columbo Reading]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I still don't know what this means.</li>
<li>It means that he knew her.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It means that he knew her
not casually, the way he said.
</p>

<p>
It means that he knew her
reasonably well.
All right.
</p>

<p>
You've got a romantic inscription
in a book and a champagne cork.
</p>

<p>
Now, what does that prove?
By itself,
it doesn't prove anything.
</p>

<p>
But once you assume
that Franklin committed these crimes,
</p>

<p>
everything fits together.
I just can't believe it.
</p>

<p>
I've known Ken too long.
He's not a murderer.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferris, it wouldn't make a difference
if you knew him for a hundred years.
</p>

<p>
That wouldn't change anything.
This man, Franklin, took your husband's life!
</p>

<p>
Do you have a match?
</p>

<p>
Help yourself. I don't smoke.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't make sense, Lieutenant!
Ken has an alibi.
</p>

<p>
What's his motive?
</p>

<p>
I told ya how he could've
worked the phone.
</p>

<p>
Now, his motive
is the insurance money.
He needed cash.
</p>

<p>
He spent money like a drunken sailor.
He had two houses.
</p>

<p>
He's got paintings.
He's got women.
</p>

<p>
He's got&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
'Jack and Jill went up the hill.
</p>

<p>
'Did Jack killJill?
</p>

<p>
If so, find out why."
</p>

<p>
Jim. One of his story ideas.
</p>

<p>
Oh.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
if Ken killed my husband,
</p>

<p>
then why did he murder
Miss La Sanka?
</p>

<p>
Well, it's my hunch
that she knew something.
</p>

<p>
Maybe she saw them together,
and she tried to blackmail him.
</p>

<p>
But that's pure guesswork, isn't it?
No, ma'am, it's not.
Not quite.
</p>

<p>
I checked the bank.
Yesterday, he took out $15,000.
</p>

<p>
Today, he put it back in again.
</p>

<p>
Now, why in the world
would he do that?
</p>

<p>
All right.
I'm still not convinced, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
let's say I'll go along.
</p>

<p>
What happens now?
I don't know.
</p>

<p>
But I've got a pretty strong
circumstantial case.
It's just not enough.
</p>

<p>
If I had one piece of hard evidence,
I could nail this fella.
</p>

<p>
But you don't.
That's right, ma'am. I don't.
That's why I'm here.
</p>

<p>
Maybe
you can give it to me.
Me?
</p>

<p>
You knew both of these fellas very well.
I want you to tell me about 'em.
</p>

<p>
Anything. Just talk&#x2026;
whatever comes into your mind.
</p>

<p>
Kind of like analysis
without the couch.
</p>

<p>
Would you like a little coffee first?
That'd be fine.
</p>

<p>
Okay.
</p>

<p>
I don't know
what you're looking for,
but here goes.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;They met in a typewriter shop,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of all places.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Jim had broken a key,
and Ken needed a ribbon.
Does that help?
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Keep goir.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, I told you lot aboutJim.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Faucet Running]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;He was brilliant, really.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;He'd wake up in the middle of the night&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with ideas&#x2026;always throwing off sparks.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I remember he even did it&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;on our honeymoon.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Chuckles]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Funny thing is that Ken
didn't even talk about the books&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
unless he was on television.
</p>

<p>
This the truck's gonna move my stuff
outta suite 803?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
You almost finished?
Haven't started.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do you mean,</li>
</ul>
<p>
you haven't started?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm only the driver, mister.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ask the other two guys.
They've been in there a half an hour already.
</p>

<p>
Half hour?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Bell Chimes]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Door Opens, Closes]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Columbo!
</p>

<p>
Oh.
Hiya, Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
Just finishing up
this last Melville mystery.
I didn't get a chance the other day.
</p>

<p>
All right.
Now, what are you doir here?
</p>

<p>
Why, I'm waiting for you.
I happened to be in the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
You're always in the neighborhood!
</p>

<p>
Can you tell me what right you've got
to keep those movers out of this office?
</p>

<p>
Oh, listen, I'm sorry about that.
It's just&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
You know what I thought?
I thought you and I should talk alone.
</p>

<p>
You and I have nothing to talk about.
Yes, we do, Mr. Franklin.
We have somethir to talk about.
</p>

<p>
I'm here to arrest ya
for the murder of your partner.
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
Now, it's my duty to inform you
of your Constitutional rights&#x2026;
Oh, will you cut that drivel?
</p>

<p>
I've written
that stuff so many times,
I know it by heart.
</p>

<p>
And what is this nonsense,
&lt;i&gt;you're&lt;/i&gt; gonna arrest &lt;i&gt;me?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Come on, Mr. Franklin.
Why don't you make a statement
and save us both a lot of trouble?
</p>

<p>
You know, I've really got ya.
</p>

<p>
All right, Lieutenant. You got me.
I'm your prisoner. Here.
</p>

<p>
Clamp the irons on me.
</p>

<p>
Do you wanna give me a dime first,
so I can phone my attorney?
</p>

<p>
Because I promise you, I'm gonna
sue you and your department&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
for false arrest
and defamation of character.
</p>

<p>
I kinda knew it
right from the start.
</p>

<p>
It was nothing definite.
It was a lot of little things.
</p>

<p>
Little things&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
driving back from San Diego
on the day of the murder
instead of taking a plane,
</p>

<p>
the open mail, never showing
any genuine emotion for a man
that you worked with for ten years&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
[Laughs]
With that, you know
what they're gonna do?
</p>

<p>
They're gonna laugh you
right outta court.
</p>

<p>
But they're not gonna laugh
at the insurance policy, are they?
</p>

<p>
I've got a photostatic copy of it
here in my pocket.
</p>

<p>
They gonna laugh at the fact that you
withdrew $15,000, put it back the next day?
</p>

<p>
I've got the book that you gave
to Miss La Sanka with your signature in it.
</p>

<p>
You expect to get
a true bill of indictment
on that&#x2026; trivia?
</p>

<p>
Come on, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
I was down in San Diego.
So was your partner.
</p>

<p>
That's a provocative statement.
Can you prove that?
</p>

<p>
Yes.
</p>

<p>
Not with the witness,
'cause you killed the witness.
But I got another way to prove it.
</p>

<p>
Well, you enlighten me.
I must say, I enjoy watching a man raise
without any cards in his hand.
</p>

<p>
You know what, Ken?
I'm gonna tell you the truth.
</p>

<p>
For a while there,
I never thought I was gonna get you.
</p>

<p>
Believe me,
you had me goir in such circles.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't figure it out.
Suddenly, I thought of something&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
how clever that first murder was&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
the phone gimmick,
working late in the office.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Brilliant.&lt;/i&gt;
Oh, are you awarding gold medals today?
</p>

<p>
Yes! For the first one,
not for the second one.
That was sloppy.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Melville,
she'd have been very disappointed.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Oh, come on, get&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to the climax, Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You're talking to a writer.
&lt;i&gt;Am I?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That's not what I heard.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
And that's the key:
That you're not a writer.
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Ferris told me
that you didn't contribute to the writing,
</p>

<p>
that her husband did all the work,
</p>

<p>
That's a lie.
I had to say to myself,
</p>

<p>
'How could a man
with no talent for mysteries
make up such a clever murder?"
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;If you were that ingenious,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you'd be able to write your own books.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Go ahead. I'm fascinated,
as boring as it may be.
</p>

<p>
Then I got it.
</p>

<p>
The first one&#x2026; the clever one&#x2026;
that wasn't yours.
</p>

<p>
The second one&#x2026;
the sloppy one&#x2026; that was yours.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But not the first.</li>
<li>Oh?</li>
</ul>

<p>
And whose idea was that, then?
</p>

<p>
Your partner's. Had to be.
</p>

<p>
And his wife told me
how conscientious he was.
</p>

<p>
You know, the way he used to write down
his ideas on every odd scrap of paper,
backs of matches, whatever&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Ahh, ah. So that's why
you wouldn't let the movers in.
</p>

<p>
Well, I had to rummage around here
before they emptied everything out.
</p>

<p>
Is this
your partner's handwriting?
</p>

<p>
Well, I think I can prove it is.
Maybe I ought to read this to ya.
</p>

<p>
'Idea for a Melville book&#x2026;

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
'and has him call his wife in city.
</p>

<p>
Tells her he's working late
at the office. Bang, bang."
</p>

<p>
Sound familiar?
That's the part you used,
</p>

<p>
practically word-for-word.
</p>

<p>
Should I read some more?
</p>

<p>
No.

</p>

<p>
With this, I think I got
a conviction, don't you?
</p>

<p>
You got to admit I had you goir
for awhile though, didn't I?
</p>

<p>
Yes, you did.
</p>

<p>
[Snickers]
You wanna know the irony
of all of this?
</p>

<p>
That &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; my idea,
</p>

<p>
the only really good one
I ever had.
</p>

<p>
I must've told it toJim
over five years ago.
</p>

<p>
Whoever thought that idiot
would write it down?
