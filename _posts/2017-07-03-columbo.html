<p>
Who is it?
</p>

<p>
Oh, you're not
intimidated, huh?
</p>

<p>
Oh, come on, Ken.
</p>

<p>
You're forgetting that
I'm one half of the world's
greatest mystery writing team.
</p>

<p>
You, uh, don't have gloves on,
your finger's not on the trigger,
</p>

<p>
and there are no bullets
in the cylinder.
</p>

<p>
You're right.
I'm a lousy practical joker.
</p>

<p>
What are you doing here
with that thing, anyway?
</p>

<p>
I was on my way down
to the cabin. I thought maybe
I could use it for protection.
</p>

<p>
Also came by to apologize.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For what?</li>
<li>For blowing my cork the other day.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I got out of line.
</p>

<p>
Forget it.
You know, that happens.
</p>

<p>
Nah. Shouldn't happen.
Not between you and me.
</p>

<p>
So, believe it or not, sir,
</p>

<p>
this is a peace pipe.
</p>

<p>
Bottoms up, Jim.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;In the middle&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of the morning?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, come on. Relax.
It's Saturday.
</p>

<p>
And in the mystery writer's soul,
it is always the middle of the night.
</p>

<p>
Oh! A toast.
</p>

<p>
Dear sir,
</p>

<p>
I give you&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
our divorce.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's not really
a divorce.
</p>

<p>
Oh, sure it is.
Come on. Let's be honest.
</p>

<p>
I mean, it's&#x2026;
There's no alimony, but, uh,
it is a termination.
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes.
And our dear little children.
</p>

<p>
All &lt;i&gt;1 5 of them.
</p>

<p>
Fifty million copies.
</p>

<p>
And to the lady who made it all possible,
the greatest sleuth in the world,
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Melville,
</p>

<p>
whom we brought to life
and now we're about to bury.
</p>

<p>
Come on, Ken.
</p>

<p>
You're making me feel guilty.
All I want to do is write on my own.
</p>

<p>
You're right.
I am being selfish.
</p>

<p>
Okay, my boy.
My blessings on your solo flight.
</p>

<p>
Thanks.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate it.
</p>

<p>
After all, friendship is more important
than partnership. Right?
</p>

<p>
Here's to our friendship.
</p>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
And now, sir,
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna kidnap you.
</p>

<p>
What?
The aforementioned cabin&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
which has been finished
for over six months now&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
You haven't seen it.
You're gonna be
my first male guest.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I can't, Ken. Not now.
Well, why can't you?
</p>

<p>
It's all the way down
in San Diego.
Oh, it's a couple of hours' drive.
</p>

<p>
I'll have you home
before midnight.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, well, I promised Joanna
I'd take her to dinner
and a show.
</p>

<p>
Aw, that's easy. You pick up that phone,
you say, ' Honey, I'm gonna be working
late at the office tonight." Come on.
</p>

<p>
Soon as we get down there,
we uncork another bottle,
and then we go fishing.
</p>

<p>
Well, I&#x2026;
You know what your trouble,
old buddy is&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I mean, you're afraid
to unwind even for a day.
Oh, no, I'm not.
</p>

<p>
Well, then, prove it.
Come on. If you want
some justification,
</p>

<p>
you're doing it
as a favor for me.
</p>

<p>
At least give me a chance
to bury the hatchet
with some style, huh?
</p>

<p>
You just don't drop your partner,
then turn down his invitation
all in one week, now do you?
</p>

<p>
Actually, the timing isn't bad.
I was just finishing the final chapter.
</p>

<p>
Ah, Mrs. Melville's last case.
</p>

<p>
You know, we ought to send
that broad some flowers.
</p>

<p>
Listen, I made a list of things
I'd like to take from the office.
</p>

<p>
You want to take
a look at it?
</p>

<p>
I don't get it.
It's a list of names.
Oh, I'm losing my mind.
</p>

<p>
It's the wrong one.
I must have left the other one
at the house.
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026; Oh, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt;
losing my mind.
</p>

<p>
What's the matter?
I left my lighter
in the office.
</p>

<p>
Do you need it?
That's my security blanket.
</p>

<p>
I'll only be a minute.
</p>

<p>
dd [Whistling]
</p>

<p>
And to think I had to
talk you into this trip.
</p>

<p>
Ah, Jim, smell that air.
How far is the cabin?
</p>

<p>
Ah, it's not far.
About an hour.
</p>

<p>
We have to skirt San Diego.
</p>

<p>
I'll only be a minute.
I just have to get some supplies.
</p>

<p>
Do you want to hand me that book
in that glove compartment?
</p>

<p>
Hey, it's one of ours.
[Chuckles]
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
The boss lady here's
a big fan of ours.
</p>

<p>
I've been promising this for months.
[Chuckles]
The price of fame.
</p>

<p>
You want me to come with you?
No, no.
I'll only be a minute.
</p>

<p>
Miss La Sanka!
</p>

<p>
Anybody home?
&lt;i&gt;In a minute!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Franklin!
</p>

<p>
Oh, my planets must be
in the right house!
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
Not only that,
but they're working overtime.
</p>

<p>
I have a surprise for you.
&lt;i&gt;Pour moi?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Pour moi.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Prescription: Murder.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
'A Mrs. Melville thriller&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
byJames Ferris
and Ken Franklin."
</p>

<p>
Oh, uh, take a look
at the first page.
</p>

<p>
You signed it?
You dear man.
</p>

<p>
Well, Mr. Franklin!
</p>

<p>
I'd rather have the storyteller
than the story.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'll tell you what.
</p>

<p>
If you play your cards right
and give me my grocery list,
someday you may have both.
</p>

<p>
Empty promises.
Miss La Sanka!
</p>

<p>
What do you need?
Just a few things
for overnight, thanks.
</p>

<p>
Who is it this week?
The blonde or the redhead?
Uh, Miss La Sanka,
</p>

<p>
I'm all alone this weekend.
</p>

<p>
Except for, uh, some
contemplation, some fishing
and a refreshment of my spirit.
</p>

<p>
Could you break this for me?
I need some change for the phone.
Thanks very much.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Cash Register Dings]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;That'll do fine.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Operator, I'd like to place
a station-to-station call
to Los Angeles.
</p>

<p>
The area code is 213.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Phone Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Hello.
Joanna, it's Ken.
</p>

<p>
Well, Ken! I thought
you werert talking to us.
</p>

<p>
Oh, that's all patched up.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact,
I leftJim at the office
a few hours ago.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We signed the armistice.</li>
<li>Oh, well, that's a relief.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Look, Joanna,
I wouldn't mention it to him.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure he'd like to
surprise you himself.
</p>

<p>
Uh, why don't you
join us for dinner?
We'll celebrate.
</p>

<p>
I'd really love to, but I'm&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'm spending the weekend
down here in San Diego
at the cabin.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact,
that's where I'm calling from.
</p>

<p>
All right. Then we'll
do it another time.
Absolutely.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Joanna, I thought maybe if you,
</p>

<p>
for some reason, needed to get
in touch with me, you do know
the number at the cabin.
</p>

<p>
Right.
I'll see you in a few days.
</p>

<p>
Fine.
</p>

<p>
Good-bye.
</p>

<p>
Did you ever get a feeling
of déjà vu?
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
Like you've, uh, done something before,
but you know you haven't.
</p>

<p>
Why?
What do you mean?
</p>

<p>
I'm getting it right now.
It's strange.
</p>

<p>
You know I've never
been here before.
</p>

<p>
Maybe in a previous
incarnation, huh?
</p>

<p>
Ken, it's fantastic.
The house
that Mrs. Melville built.
</p>

<p>
Wait till you see
the inside.
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
It's no wonder.
</p>

<p>
'No wonder" what?
</p>

<p>
What woman could resist
this setting?
</p>

<p>
Not very many.
I promise you that.
</p>

<p>
How about a drink, Jim?
More alcohol?
No, thanks.
</p>

<p>
It'll corrupt me.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
You're thinking
aboutJoanna, aren't you?
</p>

<p>
Well, yeah.
You know,
</p>

<p>
just taking off like that.
</p>

<p>
She still expects me for dinner.
We can fix that.
We'll put plan ' A" into effect.
</p>

<p>
Pick up the phone
and call her.
</p>

<p>
What am I gonna tell her?
The man is too square
for words.
</p>

<p>
Now, look. You simply say
that you're working
at the office.
</p>

<p>
You're calling from the office.
She knows you have a deadline to meet
with the book. You're working late.
</p>

<p>
How many times
have you had to do that?
A couple hundred, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Exactly.
That's why she'll believe you.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, well, I&#x2026;
I just hate lying
to her. You know.
</p>

<p>
You're not lying to her.
You're saving her
a little anguish.
</p>

<p>
Now, will you pick up the phone
and call her so we can
start enjoying ourselves?
</p>

<p>
Okay.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Oh, Operator, I'd like to</li>
</ul>
<p>
make a collect&#x2026;
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hold it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's a cinch you have never
cheated on Joanna before.
</p>

<p>
If you want your wife to believe
you're calling from the office,
</p>

<p>
you don't have the operator
place the call&#x2026; you dial it direct.
</p>

<p>
The area code is 213.
</p>

<p>
Hi, honey.
</p>

<p>
How are ya?
</p>

<p>
Well, that's what
I'm calling about.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Um, I'm at the office, and&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I'm pretty well into&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;this last chapter.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I'd like to work straight through.
Yeah, I know.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;L&#x2026; I know.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
This'll be the last time.
That I can&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Shot Fires]&lt;/i&gt;
Jimmy?
</p>

<p>
Jimmy!
</p>

<p>
Operator, get me the police.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Phone Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Hello. Joanna?
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
Joanna&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Will you take it easy?
Now, say it again once more.
</p>

<p>
Are you sure?
</p>

<p>
Did you call the police?
</p>

<p>
Yes, yes, of course.
I'll leave right away.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Joanna, please.
</p>

<p>
Take it easy.
</p>

<p>
And don't worry.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure it's nothing
but a practical joke.
</p>

<p>
Good-bye.
</p>

<p>
No, I know it's insane.
</p>

<p>
And l-l-I just&#x2026; I keep
thinking of the clichés and-and&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Jim and Ken
wrote this scene&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
in their books a hundred times.
</p>

<p>
Look at it this way, Mrs. Ferris.
Maybe he isn't dead.
</p>

<p>
Now, there's no body,
no blood&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
No! He was shot!
L-I know it!
</p>

<p>
L-l-I heard&#x2026;
I heard it on the phone.
</p>

<p>
Are you sure
it was a gunshot?
This place was searched.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Papers on the floor.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Have you any idea why?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&lt;i&gt;No, I have no idea why.&lt;/i&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Did you notice&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;anything special missing?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No, no, no.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Are you sure it was his voice?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Joanna]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Yes, I know it was his voice,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and maybe somebody&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Was he under any kind&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of extra pressure?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Joanna]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No. Maybe somebody was&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Did he say where he was calling from?</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
He said he was calling
from the office. He said&#x2026; He said&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;"I'm calling from the office."&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I really don't care&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;if anything was missing.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I just really want to find out&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;what happened to my husband.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
We'll do our best.
&lt;i&gt;You sure it was his voice?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I know it was his voice.&lt;/i&gt;
Are you sure it was a gunshot?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Yes, that's right.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Man] Would you like to sit down&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and get a glass of water?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yes, I would like&#x2026;
Really, please.
</p>

<p>
'Cause I really feel stupid,
</p>

<p>
and I just really
want to clear my head.
&lt;i&gt;Get the water.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Okay.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Columbo]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I think that's out of order, ma'am.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh, you see, that's the trouble
with these buildings.
The fountains never work.
</p>

<p>
Then you have to use
the coffee machine.
</p>

<p>
And then you lose your dime
and the coffee's lousy.
</p>

<p>
Who are you?
Uh, I'm just another cop.
</p>

<p>
My name's Columbo.
I'm a lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Were you in there&#x2026;
I got the proof right here.
</p>

<p>
You didn't see me in there
because I left before you got in there.
</p>

<p>
And you know why?
Because it's so smoky in there
and so noisy in there&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that I just had to come outside
and get a breath.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I think I'd better get back.
Now, look.
Wait a minute.
</p>

<p>
Let me tell you something.
You look very tired to me,
</p>

<p>
and I think you had
a terrible experience in there.
</p>

<p>
And I think
I ought to drive you home.
Let's call it a night.
</p>

<p>
Well, don't you think
they want to ask me questions?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I don't think they'll mind.
I think you've answered
enough questions,
</p>

<p>
and I'll call them
and I'll tell them you're with me.
</p>

<p>
Okay?
Well, what about Ken?
</p>

<p>
Why isn't Ken here?
</p>

<p>
I don't know why he isn't here.
</p>

<p>
Is that Mr. Franklin,
the other half of the writing team?
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Yeah, the other half
of the team.
</p>

<p>
You know, that's what I like
about these buttons.
</p>

<p>
You don't have to push 'em.
They go off with the heat
of your hand.
</p>

<p>
I bet you haven't had
anything to eat.
</p>

<p>
You're a very nice man, Lieutenant,
but I'm not really hungry.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you, Mrs. Ferris,
I'm the worst cook in the world.
</p>

<p>
But there's one thing I do terrific,
and that's an omelet.
</p>

<p>
Even my wife admits it.
Uh, I need something for the eggshells.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Over there in that cabinet.</li>
<li>Right.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm really not hungry.
&lt;i&gt;Listen.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You take a taste.
You don't like it,
</p>

<p>
you throw it away.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you what the secret is
to a good omelet.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No eggs. Just milk.</li>
<li>[Stifled Chuckle]</li>

<li>Uh, skillet.</li>
<li>Over there.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You're a very persuasive man,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I should hold up my end
and make the coffee.
</p>

<p>
I need cheese and onions
and, uh, butter.
</p>

<p>
Cheese&#x2026; Uh, I need something
to grate the cheese.
</p>

<p>
Over there in the cupboard.
</p>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
What did they do with him,
Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
I don't know, ma'am.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, there was no body in the office.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Couldn't that mean that he isn't dead?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, that's hard to say.
Uh, it's bothering me too.
</p>

<p>
I tell ya, the whole thing
doesn't make sense
unless it's a kidnapping.
</p>

<p>
Well, you don't shoot
a victim first, do you?
</p>

<p>
Why'd you laugh before?
When?
</p>

<p>
When I asked you if Mr. Franklin was
the other half of the writing team.
</p>

<p>
Did I laugh?
Yep.
</p>

<p>
Maybe it was the way you put it.
</p>

<p>
'Writing team."
</p>

<p>
Maybe I shouldn't say it,
</p>

<p>
but Ken hasn't written a word
of a Mrs. Melville novel in years.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Melville?
Who's Mrs. Melville?
</p>

<p>
The character
thatJim and Ken created.
</p>

<p>
The one who solves
all the crimes brilliantly.
</p>

<p>
Well, uh, why did your husband
put up with it?
</p>

<p>
What I mean is, uh,
him doing all the work.
</p>

<p>
Well, there were compensations.
</p>

<p>
Ken did the publicity,
went on all the talk shows,
</p>

<p>
and he did interviews
and cultivated the film people.
</p>

<p>
He contributed.
</p>

<p>
He just didn't do
any of the writing.
</p>

<p>
Boy, I'll tell ya,
I'd love to be a writer.
</p>

<p>
That's a terrific talent.
</p>

<p>
Where did he get
all the ideas?
</p>

<p>
Oh, from almost anything.
</p>

<p>
People. Magazines.
</p>

<p>
Conversations.
</p>

<p>
I'm constantly finding
scraps of paper
and old matchbook covers&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
just all over the house
with notes and ideas.
</p>

<p>
And those were mysteries, too,
werert they, huh?
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm.
They're tricky.
I'll tell you that.
</p>

<p>
I could never
figure those things out.
</p>

<p>
Well, it got harder.
</p>

<p>
Maybe that's why he decided
to go out on his own.
</p>

<p>
Oh, really? I didn't know that.
I guess he wanted to do
some serious work.
</p>

<p>
No kidding?
</p>

<p>
How did Mr. Franklin take that?
</p>

<p>
Not very well.
</p>

<p>
But he'll get over it.
</p>

<p>
Gee, I'd hate to be in his shoes.
Why?
</p>

<p>
Well, you got a writing team, and they're
very famous, and now they break up,
and what happens?
</p>

<p>
One fella continues writing books,
and the other fella just stops.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. That's what
I keep telling Jim&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that sooner or later,
people are bound to find out.
</p>

<p>
What, that your husband
did all the writing?
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Kind of tough
on Mr. Franklirs ego.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Doorbell Rings]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, Ken!
Jo.
</p>

<p>
I know, I know.
Just take it easy.
</p>

<p>
I drove up here
as fast as I could.
</p>

<p>
Is there anything new?
No, not yet.
</p>

<p>
Jo, it's incredible.
</p>

<p>
I just saw him
this morning at the office.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm sorry, Ken.
Uh,
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Columbo,
Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
How you doir?
No, the question is,
how you doing, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm afraid
we just got started.
</p>

<p>
Has Jim been found yet?
</p>

<p>
Has he been found yet?
Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Why? Did somebody tell you
he was gone?
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I just spent several hours
driving up here from San Diego.
</p>

<p>
You must know that this story
is on every news station.
</p>

<p>
Oh, right. Yeah.
Gee, I should have thought of that.
</p>

<p>
Well, has he been found?
Gee, I'm afraid not.
</p>

<p>
No. Were you visiting friends
in San Diego?
</p>

<p>
He has a place there&#x2026; a cabin.
Oh, away for the weekend.
Gee, that's nice.
</p>

<p>
Mmm. Could we get back
to my question?
</p>

<p>
Have you come up with
any leads, any clues?
</p>

<p>
Uh, it's a little early for that.
&lt;i&gt;Early?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Seems to me your men are
standing around just marking time.
</p>

<p>
Could I have a drink, love?
</p>

<p>
I could use one myself.
Thanks.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you something,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;See, if Mrs. Melville&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;were on this case,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
oh, she'd be leaps and bounds
ahead of you by now.
</p>

<p>
Is that the lady in the books?
&lt;i&gt;That's right.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You see, she would have
figured out that this is not
just someone missing.
</p>

<p>
This is a professional killing.
</p>

<p>
Aha. Here it is.
</p>

<p>
Take a look at that.
Uh, put it on the desk.
</p>

<p>
Just drop it. 'Cause of
the fingerprints, you know.
</p>

<p>
Jim's fingerprints
are all over that.
So are mine.
</p>

<p>
What is it?
What's it look like?
It's a list of names.
</p>

<p>
Look at that. Mustel,
Delgado, Hathaway, Westlake&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Sound familiar?
Uh, yeah, kinda.
</p>

<p>
Well, they should. That's a list
of some of the top men
in organized crime on the West Coast&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
L.A., Vegas, Frisco&#x2026;
I don't understand.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's painfully obvious.
</p>

<p>
One of these men
had Jim killed.
</p>

<p>
Really? Why?
</p>

<p>
Tell me something.
How long have you been
a lieutenant, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Melville would have
put that together like that.
[Snaps Fingers]
</p>

<p>
Look, I&#x2026; I'm willing to take
all the help I can get.
</p>

<p>
All right. Let me see
if I can explain it to you.
</p>

<p>
See, my partner and I
decided to split,
go our separate ways.
</p>

<p>
I'm sureJoanna must have
mentioned that to you.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, she said
something about that.
</p>

<p>
Did she also mention the fact
thatJim wanted to do
some serious writing?
</p>

<p>
Hey.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
</p>

<p>
Wait a minute. Yeah!
Dawning on you now?
I knew you'd get it.
</p>

<p>
But that's only
the tip of the iceberg.
</p>

<p>
You see, Jim was researching
a complete and factual exposé&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
of all West Coast organized crime.
</p>

<p>
I mean, he was going around asking
some pretty embarrassing questions.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Probing.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Compiling dossiers.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;That's why&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;they searched this office.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Apparently, they got everything
but that list.
</p>

<p>
And you think one of these fellas
put out a contract on him.
</p>

<p>
Of course. Word must have gotten around
thatJim was compiling all this information.
</p>

<p>
They knew they couldn't buy him off,
so what do they do?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;They chose the usual&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;alternative.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Professional killing, huh?
But if that's true,
why did they get rid of the body?
</p>

<p>
Well, who knows?
But remember one thing&#x2026;
Without a corpus delicti,
</p>

<p>
you can't prove a murder
was committed in the first place.
</p>

<p>
But why would
a professional killer care?
</p>

<p>
I mean, he's already on a plane
back from where he came.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I can't answer
all your questions. I've given you
a list of the most likely suspects.
</p>

<p>
A clear motive.
Isn't that enough to start with?
</p>

<p>
Oh, that's plenty.
And believe me, I'm very grateful
for all the help you've given me.
</p>

<p>
Gee, that's funny.
What?
</p>

<p>
Well, this thing is folded lengthwise,
like someone was carrying it
in their pocket.
</p>

<p>
So?
</p>

<p>
Well, if he typed that
on that typewriter&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and I'll run a check on that&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
why would he fold it up
before he put it in that drawer?
</p>

<p>
[Chuckling]
I'm beginning to like you.
</p>

<p>
Why is that?
Because you're finally beginning
to think like Mrs. Melville.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Jim used to
fold up a piece of paper,
</p>

<p>
and he'd use it
as a bookmark, you know.
Ah.
</p>

<p>
Now, however interesting
your observation is,
</p>

<p>
it only leads us far astray.
</p>

<p>
However,
since you are beginning to learn
how to emulate our dear lady,
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna give you something
that you richly deserve&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
a chance to read
some of our books.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's very nice of you.
Didn't expect gifts tonight, huh?
</p>

<p>
Thank you. Maybe I can
pick up a few pointers.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm sure you can.
</p>

<p>
Uh, could you handle
some more?
Oh, all right.
</p>

<p>
Here you go.
Oh, and an extra.
Oh, that's very nice.
</p>

<p>
That ought to keep you busy
for a while, huh?
Yeah, it sure will.
</p>

<p>
Well, anything else, Lieutenant?
Uh, no, I don't think so.
</p>

<p>
I think I'd better let you
get some sleep.
Oh, that's very nice of you.
</p>

<p>
I just only hope
I was of some help.
Oh, you certainly were.
</p>

<p>
Well, good night, Lieutenant.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mr. Franklin. Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Actually, uh, there is one thing,
</p>

<p>
not that it makes
that much difference.
</p>

<p>
What is it?
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Ferris called you
and told you her husband got shot,
</p>

<p>
you jumped in a car and drove
right back to L.A.
</p>

<p>
Is that right?
That's right.
</p>

<p>
You know, me,
I'd have taken a plane.
</p>

<p>
I mean, it's a big airport,
and they run every half hour.
It'd been a lot faster.
</p>

<p>
Well, I&#x2026; That's true,
but in a situation like that,
who thinks clearly?
</p>

<p>
And look at it this way.
You add up all the time it takes
to drive to and from an airport,
</p>

<p>
how much time
do you really save?
</p>

<p>
Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Operator, would you get me
the police, please?
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Lt. Columbo, please.
</p>

<p>
Yes, thank you.
I'll wait.
</p>

<p>
Columbo, this is Franklin.
</p>

<p>
I think you better get over here
right away.
</p>

<p>
937 Skyview Drive.
</p>

<p>
It's an emergency.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Woman On Police Radio: Indistinct]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Woman on Radio]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;1- L 10. MPs have been notified.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Do you still request&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a radio unit?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man On Radio]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;All units in the vicinity,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;a prowler, 12F3&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Fades]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
When I got home, there he&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
there it was, right
in the middle of the lawn.
</p>

<p>
Terrible thing to come home to.
</p>

<p>
The funny thing is, I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I kept hoping or I&#x2026;
I was sure thatJim was still alive.
</p>

<p>
PoorJoanna.
</p>

<p>
Every time I think of
feeling sorry for myself,
</p>

<p>
I think of how much
&lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; had to lose.
</p>

<p>
Look at 'em!
</p>

<p>
Vultures!
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, you mind
if I go inside? I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
can't stand
to watch them&#x2026; gape.
</p>

<p>
Listen. You mind
if I come with you?
</p>

<p>
Because there's no lining
in this coat, and I'm a bit chilly.
</p>

<p>
I don't mind.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Phone Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Hello.
</p>

<p>
Yes, this is Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
What? No comment.
</p>

<p>
Aw, you've gotta be kidding.
You want an interview now?
</p>

<p>
A gentleman of the press.
&lt;i&gt;Afraid you're gonna get&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a lot of that.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I'm forgetting my manners.
Would you like a drink?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Yeah. Mmm.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Maybe a drop ofbourbon.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Bourbon.
</p>

<p>
Boy, this is quite a place.
</p>

<p>
This a copy?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Hardly.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It's an original.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Gee, I thought they only
hung this stuff on museums.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You own this?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Melville has been very kind.
</p>

<p>
Boy. Quite a place.
</p>

<p>
Gee whiz. And you got
that other place in San Diego.
</p>

<p>
Gee, the upkeep alone must be&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I manage to scrape by.
Your drink.
</p>

<p>
Thank you. You know,
there's one thing about writers
that I don't understand.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you can help me
clear it up.
</p>

<p>
If a fella's partner dies,
</p>

<p>
uh, does he own the other
fella's half of the books,
half of the, uh, um&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Royalties?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
No. They go
into the deceased's estate.
</p>

<p>
Mmm. That leaves you
out in the cold, doesn't it?
</p>

<p>
Unless, of course,
you insured each other.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, aren't we going
a bit far astray?
</p>

<p>
You're right. We shouldn't
be talking about this now.
</p>

<p>
It's not the time.
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026; Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
So, Mr. Franklin, tell me, uh,
</p>

<p>
why do you think that they left
your partner's body out there
on the lawn like that?
</p>

<p>
Do you mean to tell me
you haven't figured that out?
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
you disappoint me.
</p>

<p>
It was left as a warning.
A warning?
</p>

<p>
Of course.
</p>

<p>
It also proves my theory about
it being a professional killing.
</p>

<p>
See, the moment they dropped
Jim's body in the middle
of that lawn&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Please, sit down.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You know&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;what they were saying?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
That this could happen to you&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
unless you stop
in your partner's research.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They're trying to scare you.</li>
<li>Exactly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
So what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna continue
writing the book anyway?
</p>

<p>
No, that's the irony of it.
You see, that was Jim's
pet project, not mine.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.
</p>

<p>
Say, I guess they didn't have
any way of knowing
you two were gonna split up.
</p>

<p>
Nah. Even if they did,
it wouldn't have doneJim any good.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I must say, Lieutenant,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you're up against a dead end.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Look at this.
You got a body,
</p>

<p>
you got a motive,
</p>

<p>
but you're never
gonna find that killer.
</p>

<p>
It's not gonna be easy.
</p>

<p>
I'll lay you 5 to &lt;i&gt;1
it was someone
in Las Vegas or Miami.
</p>

<p>
Picked up a phone and&#x2026;
pfft! &#x2026;put out a contract.
Right. Right.
</p>

<p>
How you're gonna make a case,
much less solve one,
is beyond me.
</p>

<p>
I know. I guess the only thing
I can do is&#x2026; just check out
every name on that list.
</p>

<p>
Sure. You know what's gonna
happen? Every one of those guys
is gonna deny thatJim even existed.
</p>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
I must say
I don't envy you.
I don't envy myself.
</p>

<p>
Now, look. I got a lot
of phone calls to make.
I'd better get on it, huh?
</p>

<p>
All the luck.
Thanks. Thanks a lot,
Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
And listen. I'm very sorry
about what happened tonight.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
Right.
</p>

<p>
You, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You will keep me posted,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant?&lt;/i&gt;
Oh, yes, I will. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
You know, there's only one thing
that I'm not clear about.
</p>

<p>
But that can wait.
You want to go to bed.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I'm not gonna
get any sleep anyway.
What is it?
</p>

<p>
Would you go over for me
once again&#x2026; I know you did it&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
exactly what happened
when you came home tonight?
</p>

<p>
Sure. L&#x2026;
I've already told you, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
The moment I saw Jim's body
in the middle of the lawn,
</p>

<p>
I came running in here
and I picked up the phone
and I called you.
</p>

<p>
I mean, it's a purely
reflexive action.
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh.
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh. That's fine.
Now, wait a minute.
You look like you're troubled.
</p>

<p>
Is there some reason
for your question?
</p>

<p>
Uh, it's your mail.
</p>

<p>
My mail?
Isn't it funny
how people are different?
</p>

<p>
Now, me, if I found my partner dead,
I'd never think of opening my letters.
</p>

<p>
But I-I&#x2026; I just did it
to distract myself.
</p>

<p>
I mean, you got to remember
one thing, that's a great shock.
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
Oh, that's understandable.
</p>

<p>
And bills are distracting.
Listen, if anything comes up,
</p>

<p>
I'll call you right away.
</p>

<p>
Good night.
Good night.
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna have a hot dog.
I guess I will too.
</p>

<p>
No, no, Mr. Tucker.
You put that away.
</p>

<p>
This one's on me.
</p>

<p>
May I have a receipt, please?
</p>

<p>
All right, Lieutenant.
You're bribing me
with a handsome lunch.
</p>

<p>
What can I do for you?
Uh, this is about
an insurance policy.
</p>

<p>
Oh, excellent.
It's about time you came to me.
</p>

<p>
I can give you
a package within your&#x2026;
Yeah, this is, uh,
</p>

<p>
an insurance policy
that was already written.
</p>

<p>
Oh, this is official business.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, there are two mystery writers&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Ken Franklin and James Ferris.
</p>

<p>
Your company
wrote a policy on them?
Now, wait a minute, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
We like to cooperate
with the police, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
if you want confidential information,
I'm afraid that you&#x2026;
Oh, well, look, uh,
</p>

<p>
I don't want to cause you any trouble.
</p>

<p>
Maybe it'll be more helpful
if I got a court order?
</p>

<p>
[Chattering]
</p>

<p>
[Chattering Continues]
</p>

<p>
Oh, Ken, it was simply marvelous.
I was terrified.
</p>

<p>
Oh, really?
I had the whole thing figured out
by the end of the first act.
</p>

<p>
Oh, you did?
I was completely fooled.
</p>

<p>
You must have a devious mind.
No, dear,
it's because you're young.
</p>

<p>
Always remember
one thing, my love.
</p>

<p>
The moment
a man mentions a long-lost twin,
</p>

<p>
you can inevitably know that it's
going to be some impersonation.
</p>

<p>
It's an old plot trick.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Franklin! Yoo-hoo!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Over here!</li>
<li>Who's that?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Someone
that should be somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No, we go this way.&lt;/i&gt;
Excuse me a moment.
</p>

<p>
Miss La Sanka,
what a pleasant surprise.
Hi. [Giggling]
</p>

<p>
What brings you to the big city?
Oh, I came in to do
a little shopping.
</p>

<p>
You&#x2026; You like my dress?
Oh, it's lovely.
</p>

<p>
See a play.
[Laughs]
</p>

<p>
She's a beauty,
Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Yes, she is.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Uh, thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I haven't seen her before
have I?
</p>

<p>
No, I don't believe you have.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's&#x2026;
it's lovely to see you.
I, uh,
</p>

<p>
hope you won't think
I'm being forward,
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
But is there any chance of, uh,
our having a drink together?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'd&#x2026; I'd love to, really.
But, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
See, the young lady and I
are going to have a late supper.
</p>

<p>
I think you might want to cancel it.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Just why would I want to do that?</li>
<li>Because&#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
we really should have a discussion.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Perhaps some other time.
All right. L&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I suppose I'll have to find
someone else to tell my story to.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
It's a mystery story.
</p>

<p>
Very interesting.
Really.
</p>

<p>
It's all about this witness.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Just wait here.
I'll be right back.
</p>

<p>
Anything you say, Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
d &lt;i&gt;[Piano]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
Oh, wow!
</p>

<p>
Oh, I just can't resist
strawberries.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm glad you like them.
</p>

<p>
[Giggling]
</p>

<p>
[Giggling Continues]
You're&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
You're making me nervous.
</p>

<p>
That's quite a stare.
I'm sorry.
L-I can't help it.
</p>

<p>
You know,
I've never seen you outside
that store before.
</p>

<p>
You're very lovely.
</p>

<p>
May I call you Lili?
Yes, please do.
[Giggles]
</p>

<p>
How did you enjoy
the play tonight?
Oh, I thought
it was predictable. You?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I like your books
much more.
That's very flattering.
</p>

<p>
But you said something before
about, uh,
</p>

<p>
about your story
or something about a&#x2026;
a witness.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes. Well, actually,
</p>

<p>
it's a, uh,
true-to-life story.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the best kind.
[Giggles]
</p>

<p>
It concerns your partner.
Jim?
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh.
What about him?
</p>

<p>
Well, I read in the papers
about his death,
</p>

<p>
and I felt just terrible.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
I felt just terrible, because they said
he was killed in his office.
</p>

<p>
So they did.
Well,
</p>

<p>
in my story, you see,
</p>

<p>
he couldn't have actually
been killed in an office,
</p>

<p>
because he was, uh,
</p>

<p>
somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
Just for a moment,
let's forget about your story,
</p>

<p>
and let's, uh&#x2026;
let's talk about real life.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
It is simpler, isn't it?
Much.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you honestly, Ken.
</p>

<p>
I was very confused
when I saw the papers,
because,
</p>

<p>
when you were in my store
making a phone call the other day,
Uh-huh.
</p>

<p>
I wandered over
to the side window to see&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
if you had brought a lady with you.
[Giggles]
</p>

<p>
You didn't believe me when I said
that I was alone.
Oh, I believed you.
It's just that&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'm very interested in you, Ken.
</p>

<p>
[Giggles]
Well, anyway,
</p>

<p>
you can imagine my surprise
when I saw your partner.
</p>

<p>
There he was, big as life,
</p>

<p>
sitting there
in the front seat of your car.
</p>

<p>
And that disturbed you, huh?
Oh, not at that time.
</p>

<p>
Only later.
</p>

<p>
And then I debated
with myself for days&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
whether to come
and see you or not.
</p>

<p>
Why didn't you go to the police?
Oh, Ken.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't want
to get you into trouble.
[Giggling]
</p>

<p>
Of course not.
[Snorting Chuckle]
All right, Lili. How much?
</p>

<p>
[Laughs]
I hope you don't think that
that's the on&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't think anything.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you something.
I'm most grateful you came to me first.
</p>

<p>
Know why?
Because I think we can reach
an equitable agreement.
</p>

<p>
I do so admire your candor.
</p>

<p>
This isn't easy for me&#x2026;
a widow running a&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
small country store,
trying to make ends meet.
Oh, I can understand that.
</p>

<p>
And I also recognize in you
a woman of&#x2026; of some breeding.
</p>

<p>
I mean, you're not just
a common&#x2026; blackmailer.
</p>

<p>
I'm so glad you're understanding.
</p>

<p>
Very well, Lili.
</p>

<p>
How much for your silence?
</p>

<p>
$15,000? L&#x2026;
&lt;i&gt;[Plate Clattering]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh! L-I know it's a lot,
but that's all I'll ever ask for.
Honestly.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>And I'm a woman of my word!</li>
<li>I know you are, and I respect you for that.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And you know what?
</p>

<p>
In that spirit, I accept your terms.
Agreed?
</p>

<p>
[Relieved Chuckle]
Agreed.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
And I know you won't take offense
when I say,
</p>

<p>
'It's a pleasure
doing business with you."
</p>

<p>
No, no. My pleasure.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
[Both Chuckling]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>[Chuckling Continues]</li>
<li>&lt;i&gt;[Doorbell Chiming]&lt;/i&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yes?
Is Mr. Franklin home?
</p>

<p>
He's occupied at the moment.
Who shall I say is calling?
</p>

<p>
Uh, Lt. Columbo.
Oh. Well, won't you
come in and wait?
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
He'll be with you shortly.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Camera Shutter Clicking]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Man]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Only a few more.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Thanks muchly, Mr. Franklin.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I think we're about finished,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
if you can bear
one or two more photographs.
&lt;i&gt;Fire away.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
After all, your magazine
was very kind to Franklin and Ferris
during our lean years.
</p>

<p>
That's, uh, the second reason
I granted the interview.
Oh? What was the first?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why, the charm</li>
</ul>
<p>
of the interviewer, of course.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thank you.</li>

<li>&lt;i&gt;[Thump]&lt;/i&gt;</li>
<li>[Shutter Clicks]</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yes, Lieutenant.
Is there something I can do for you?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah. If-lf you&#x2026;
If you have a moment.
</p>

<p>
That's about all I do have.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I finish here,
I'll be right with you.
</p>

<p>
Is there anything else, Miss, uh&#x2026;
May I call you Gloria?
Please do.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Uh, just one last question.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I think our readers will want to know
how the death of your partner will affect
the Mrs. Melville books.
</p>

<p>
I'm afraid when I buried Jim
I buried Mrs. Melville with him.
</p>

<p>
Mmm, I understand.
</p>

<p>
But everyone will miss her so.
Can't you write another one?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I could, naturally,
but what's the point?
</p>

<p>
With Jim gone, there&#x2026;
[Smacks Lips]
Wouldn't be much reason.
</p>

<p>
No, I'm afraid, uh,
Mrs. Melville has solved
her last case.
</p>

<p>
Actually, I've been&#x2026;
seriously debating as to whether
I would ever want to write again.
</p>

<p>
Oh, well, I hope you do.
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you don't mind, huh?
Of course.
Let's go Harvey.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps,
under better circumstances,
I, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
less harassed circumstances&#x2026;
I could give you a more detailed interview.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Even in more depth.</li>
<li>&lt;i&gt;Mmm, that'll be nice.&lt;/i&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>
Shall I call you?
Yes. Please do.
Next week, huh?
</p>

<p>
Good-bye.
</p>

<p>
Oh, sorry, Harvey.
Thanks, very much.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
All right, Lieutenant.
What can I do for you?
</p>

<p>
Well, I brought back your books.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, that's fine.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Just put 'em over there&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;on the table.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Uh, sure.
I wanted to tell ya how much
I enjoyed 'em.
</p>

<p>
I think they're the most terrific&#x2026;
Boy, I wanna&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
And&#x2026; Oh, listen, I'll come back.
I'll make two trips on this.
</p>

<p>
But the&#x2026; the lady detective&#x2026;
What a character, what a brain.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And what logic!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The way she figures it out!&lt;/i&gt;
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
I'd love to sit down
and discuss literature with you,
but I was on my way out.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
</p>

<p>
I didn't mean to bother ya.
Uh, you goir someplace special?
</p>

<p>
Yes, as a matter of fact.
I'm on my way down to my cabin
for a rest.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Would you like an itinerary?</li>
<li>Hey, I'm sorry.</li>

<li>I'm makir a pest of myself.</li>
<li>No.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yes, yes, I am.
I know, it's because I keep
askir these questions.
</p>

<p>
But I'll tell ya.
I can't help myself.
</p>

<p>
It's a habit.
I take it you're not goir alone.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Whatever gave that idea?</li>
<li>I noticed the two bottles of champagne.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oh, those. Oh, I'm quite capable
of drinking those two bottles&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and a good deal more
without any help.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Uh, listen.
Unless you just wanna take a second&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
to know how we're progressir
on your partner's list.
</p>

<p>
Oh?
Anything concrete?
</p>

<p>
No, not a thing.
Just like you predicted.
</p>

<p>
Everyone said
they never even heard ofJames Ferris.
</p>

<p>
[Smacks Lips]
That's just as I expected.
</p>

<p>
Well, it was lovely to chat with you,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mr. Franklin?
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Is it important?
Well, it could be.
You see, I was checking the, uh,
</p>

<p>
the phone company records
in San Diego.
</p>

<p>
Now, why would you want
to do that, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Oh, well, I have to do that.
You know, that's part of my job.
I got to tie up all those loose ends.
</p>

<p>
Anyway,
on the day of the murder&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
there was a record
of a call from the cabin.
</p>

<p>
It was a call to the Ferris house
in Los Angeles.
</p>

<p>
I see.
And now you're wondering whether
I can explain that. Is that right?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm sure you can.
Oh, you're right. I can.
</p>

<p>
But, you see, you would've saved
both you and me a great deal of trouble&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
if you'd checked
with Joanna Ferris first.
</p>

<p>
She would've explained to you
that I'd spoken with her from my cabin,
</p>

<p>
telling her thatJim and I had
patched up our differences.
</p>

<p>
Oh, what do you mean
by ' differences"? Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Well, you see,
ironing out any difficulties
in a separation is never easy.
</p>

<p>
And I knew Joanna would be concerned,
and I wanted to put her mind at ease.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I see.
Can you understand that?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes. Yeah, that's understandable.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh, fine. Is that all?
</p>

<p>
Yes, that's all. Right.
Good.
</p>

<p>
[Snickers]
Listen, uh,
enjoy your trip.
</p>

<p>
Thanks very much.
</p>

<p>
And drive carefully.
[Engine Starts]
</p>

<p>
Don't worry, Lieutenant.
You can count on it.
</p>

<p>
And&#x2026; here you are!
[Laughs]
</p>

<p>
Bearing gifts.
</p>

<p>
And more gifts.
Why, Mr. Franklin, how lovely.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Ken.
Yes, of course. Ken.
</p>

<p>
Now, Lili, let me ask
you a simple question.
</p>

<p>
You up to making a nice,
quiet dinner for two tonight?
</p>

<p>
d &lt;i&gt;[Orchestra: Romantic]&lt;/i&gt;
Here's to&#x2026; prosperity.
</p>

<p>
And romance.
</p>

<p>
[Both Chuckling]
</p>

<p>
A daily double.
&lt;i&gt;[Laughing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, I must say, Lili,
that was a magnificent meal.
</p>

<p>
Where'd you learn
to cook so well?
</p>

<p>
My late husband,
may he rest in peace,
</p>

<p>
was a professional chef.
</p>

<p>
Wonderful man.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
He taught me all I know.
Well, he taught you well.
</p>

<p>
Thank you, sir.
</p>

<p>
Refill?
Oh, sorry.
</p>

<p>
Oop!
We're all out.
[Laughs]
</p>

<p>
Let's open another one.
Dare we?
</p>

<p>
Dare we not?
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm!
</p>

<p>
Here we go. Happy New Year!
[Cork Pops]
</p>

<p>
[Both Laughing]
Quick, the glass.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing Continues]
</p>

<p>
Oh! Mmm!
</p>

<p>
Delicious!
</p>

<p>
But I'm afraid
I'm getting a little tipsy.
</p>

<p>
What's wrong with that?
</p>

<p>
[Slurred]
I don't know if I can trust you.
</p>

<p>
Now,
is there any reason not to?
</p>

<p>
Lili, if I make you uncomfortable,
I can always leave.
</p>

<p>
No. Please.
I do enjoy your company.
</p>

<p>
You know what we should do?
What?
</p>

<p>
It's such a beautiful night,
we should&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
row out
to the center of the lake and&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
go for a swim.
Mmm.
Sounds nice.
</p>

<p>
Mmm. Is nice. Shall we?
</p>

<p>
Better not.
Why not?
</p>

<p>
I trust you, Ken.
Really.
</p>

<p>
But we all have
our dark sides, don't we?
</p>

<p>
Just wouldn't be very intelligent of me
to be alone with you in a small boat.
</p>

<p>
After all, you might start having
second thoughts about the money.
</p>

<p>
I wish
you hadrt said that, Lili.
</p>

<p>
That kind of talk
hurts me deeply.
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna tell you something,
and I shouldn't.
</p>

<p>
But I'll tell you why,
because I trust you.
</p>

<p>
I was prepared to give you
considerably more than you asked for.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen thousand&#x2026; I mean,
I've lost that much gambling
in one night.
</p>

<p>
Well, it certainly
is a great deal of money to me.
</p>

<p>
What do you think you'll, uh&#x2026;
you'll do with all of it?
</p>

<p>
I don't know.
Put it in the bank, I guess.
</p>

<p>
But not right away.
</p>

<p>
Ohh!
I just want to look at it for awhile.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
d &lt;i&gt;[Continues]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Better be careful.
</p>

<p>
Someone might, uh,
rob you.
</p>

<p>
I'll just keep it for a day or two.
</p>

<p>
I've never seen
so much money in my life.
</p>

<p>
Uh,
</p>

<p>
maybe&#x2026;
maybe you could take a&#x2026;
a trip somewhere, huh?
</p>

<p>
I may. I've always
wanted to go on a cruise.
</p>

<p>
Oh, cruises,
they're so romantic.
</p>

<p>
Did I tell you that my late husband
was in the merchant marines?
</p>

<p>
Is that a fact?
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
They're the ones
who taught him how to cook.
</p>

<p>
I almost wish he were here now.
</p>

<p>
He could share this with me.
</p>

<p>
Or maybe we can do
the next best thing.
</p>

<p>
[No Audio]
</p>

<p>
Who did you say it is?
One of the cops said
it was a local woman.
</p>

<p>
Some kind of drowning.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Woman On Police Radio]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Twelve A-15, clear.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Twelve A-17, are you clear?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Twelve A-1, clear.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Twelve A-15, stand by.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;One L-10, M.P. S have been notified.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
dd [Whistling]
</p>

<p>
dd [Stops]
</p>

<p>
Mornir!
</p>

<p>
Well, Lt. Columbo.
I must say, you turn up
at the oddest times, don't you?
</p>

<p>
Listen, I hope you don't mind
my comir in that way, you know.
</p>

<p>
But the door was open,
and I just let myself in.
Oh, no.
</p>

<p>
How'd you get here? By magic carpet?
I didn't see your car outside.
</p>

<p>
Oh, no. I pulled around back,
and I put it in the shade.
</p>

<p>
You know,
the sun raises hell with the paint.
Oh, sensible.
</p>

<p>
Well, what brings you
up here to the wilds?
</p>

<p>
Well, I'll tell ya.
I heard you and Mrs. Ferris talk
so much about this place,
</p>

<p>
and you made it sound so terrific,
and believe me, uh,
</p>

<p>
you werert exaggerating,
because&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
this is magnificent.
</p>

<p>
And, uh, since I got
a two-week vacation comir up,
</p>

<p>
I said to myself, ' Go on down there,
check out the area, look to see.
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you can rent a cabin."
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, you're not gonna tell me
you drove down here just to look
for a vacation spot, are you?
</p>

<p>
Why else would I come?
You're wasting your time.
</p>

<p>
I have a feeling that cabins
in this neck of the woods are pretty much
out of your price range, anyway.
</p>

<p>
Most of them are&#x2026;
are rented for the season.
</p>

<p>
Oh, gee whiz, that's&#x2026;
that's too bad.
</p>

<p>
Gosh, my wife
is gonna be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
Well, it was a nice ride, anyhow.
Yes, a lovely drive.
</p>

<p>
Except for that
bottleneck down the road.
What was that all about?
</p>

<p>
Oh, there was a drowning.
&lt;i&gt;Well, what was it,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a fisherman?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, I heard someone say
it was a local woman.
</p>

<p>
Uh, a Miss La Sanka
or something like that?
Something like that, yeah.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Did you know her?
Not really, no.
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering, because,
when I was in the kitchen before,
</p>

<p>
I noticed a grocery box
with her name on it.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I occasionally buy supplies
there, sure, like anyone else
who lives around here.
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh.
I think she was the one
that drowned. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
'Cause I, uh, stopped by
the grocery store on the way here
to pick up some cigars,
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;and I noticed it was closed&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and the cops'cars around.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, if it was her,
I&#x2026; I'd be very sorry.
</p>

<p>
She was always very friendly.
Yeah, that's a shame.
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm.
[Sucks Teeth]
Oh, you &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; know her.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I know a lot of people
without really knowing them.
</p>

<p>
You know, like barbers,
waitresses, parking lot attendants,
</p>

<p>
even the cop on the beat.
</p>

<p>
Don't you?
Yeah. [Chuckling]
Yeah, I do, matter of fact.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you, though.
People are strange.
</p>

<p>
You know, I can't figure 'em out.
Why a woman goes out on a lake
all by herself&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
before the light comes up.
Oh, there's nothing
unusual about that.
</p>

<p>
A lot of us go out early.
</p>

<p>
It's peaceful
and kind of makes
you feel like you're&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
plugged into nature.
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
Know what I mean?
Yeah. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Well, say, listen.
Look, you came down here&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
to get away from things,
and I'm just takir up your time.
</p>

<p>
I didn't mean to bother you.
No, no, no.
It's no bother at all.
</p>

<p>
Say, I'd be more than glad
to let you have a bathing suit,
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;but, uh, you don't look like&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the athletic type to me.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, it's, uh, my wife
that's the athlete.
</p>

<p>
Oh?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
So, you don't think I'm gonna
be able to find a cabin to rent, huh?
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
Best bet is to go down and check
with some of the local real estate people.
Uh-huh.
</p>

<p>
Because I think it'd be fun
to be neighbors for a couple of weeks.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
[Laughs] Y-Yeah.
Say, what kind of nightlife
do you have around here?
</p>

<p>
Nightlife? None.
</p>

<p>
No partying?
Just sleep and crickets.
</p>

<p>
Gee, I was just wonderir,
because,
</p>

<p>
you know, I didn't want
to barge in on you today
unannounced.
</p>

<p>
I don't follow you.
No, last night I called
to tell ya that I was comir.
</p>

<p>
But there was no one at home.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Woman On Police Radio,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Indistinct]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Uh, you a reporter?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh, no, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Uh, Lieutenant, uh,
Columbo,
</p>

<p>
uh, police.
</p>

<p>
L.A. Unit.
All right.
</p>

<p>
L.A.P.D.
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
What brings you down here,
Lieutenant?
Well, I'm workir on a case.
</p>

<p>
Uh, listen,
this is not really my jurisdiction,
</p>

<p>
but do&#x2026;
do ya mind if I browse around?
</p>

<p>
Well, help yourself, Lieutenant.
Always glad to cooperate.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Didn't she have a bruise on her head?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man] How'd you know that, Ben?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, come on, Sergeant.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Doc Webster told us.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;All right, so there was a bruise.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Probably as a result of the boat capsizing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and rendering her unconscious.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Any indication the lady
was under the influence?
</p>

<p>
I can't ascertain that
until we see an autopsy report.
</p>

<p>
The doctor's
working on that right now.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #1]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Sounds like drinkirto me.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #2] Could she swim?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Sergeant] How would I know&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a thing like that?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I wasn't married to the lady.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #3] Any living relatives?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I don't think so.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Somebody said she was a widow.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #3]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How about the rowboat?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Rowboat? What about it?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, who'd it belong to?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Where'd it come from?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It belonged to the deceased.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I've got witnesses that have seen her&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;take it out on the lake.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Voices Continue, Indistinct]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #1]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Think she wanted&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;some fresh air last night?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Sergeant]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This is all conjecture, gentlemen.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I mean, there's no way of telling.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Maybe she did.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Who knows?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It's also possible&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that she had a heart seizure&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;or she got dizzy.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #3]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Then you think it was an accident.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I certainly don't think it was foul play.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You gonna be in your office&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;this afternoon?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Sergeant] Absolutely.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Reporter #1]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How long was she in the water, Sergeant?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, I don't know.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Wait'll we get the report.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We're startirto cover the same&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;old ground here, gentlemen.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Now, why don't you meet me&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in my office an hour from now.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, we've got some&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;more questions here we'd like&lt;/i&gt; to&#x2026;
&lt;i&gt;I'll answer 'em all then.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I'll have the reports, and I'll be able&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to give a lot more information. Okay?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Okay, Sarge, thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Columbo Reading]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I still don't know what this means.</li>
<li>It means that he knew her.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It means that he knew her
not casually, the way he said.
</p>

<p>
It means that he knew her
reasonably well.
All right.
</p>

<p>
You've got a romantic inscription
in a book and a champagne cork.
</p>

<p>
Now, what does that prove?
By itself,
it doesn't prove anything.
</p>

<p>
But once you assume
that Franklin committed these crimes,
</p>

<p>
everything fits together.
I just can't believe it.
</p>

<p>
I've known Ken too long.
He's not a murderer.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ferris, it wouldn't make a difference
if you knew him for a hundred years.
</p>

<p>
That wouldn't change anything.
This man, Franklin, took your husband's life!
</p>

<p>
Do you have a match?
</p>

<p>
Help yourself. I don't smoke.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't make sense, Lieutenant!
Ken has an alibi.
</p>

<p>
What's his motive?
</p>

<p>
I told ya how he could've
worked the phone.
</p>

<p>
Now, his motive
is the insurance money.
He needed cash.
</p>

<p>
He spent money like a drunken sailor.
He had two houses.
</p>

<p>
He's got paintings.
He's got women.
</p>

<p>
He's got&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
'Jack and Jill went up the hill.
</p>

<p>
'Did Jack killJill?
</p>

<p>
If so, find out why."
</p>

<p>
Jim. One of his story ideas.
</p>

<p>
Oh.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
if Ken killed my husband,
</p>

<p>
then why did he murder
Miss La Sanka?
</p>

<p>
Well, it's my hunch
that she knew something.
</p>

<p>
Maybe she saw them together,
and she tried to blackmail him.
</p>

<p>
But that's pure guesswork, isn't it?
No, ma'am, it's not.
Not quite.
</p>

<p>
I checked the bank.
Yesterday, he took out $15,000.
</p>

<p>
Today, he put it back in again.
</p>

<p>
Now, why in the world
would he do that?
</p>

<p>
All right.
I'm still not convinced, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
let's say I'll go along.
</p>

<p>
What happens now?
I don't know.
</p>

<p>
But I've got a pretty strong
circumstantial case.
It's just not enough.
</p>

<p>
If I had one piece of hard evidence,
I could nail this fella.
</p>

<p>
But you don't.
That's right, ma'am. I don't.
That's why I'm here.
</p>

<p>
Maybe
you can give it to me.
Me?
</p>

<p>
You knew both of these fellas very well.
I want you to tell me about 'em.
</p>

<p>
Anything. Just talk&#x2026;
whatever comes into your mind.
</p>

<p>
Kind of like analysis
without the couch.
</p>

<p>
Would you like a little coffee first?
That'd be fine.
</p>

<p>
Okay.
</p>

<p>
I don't know
what you're looking for,
but here goes.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;They met in a typewriter shop,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of all places.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Jim had broken a key,
and Ken needed a ribbon.
Does that help?
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Keep goir.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, I told you lot aboutJim.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Faucet Running]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;He was brilliant, really.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;He'd wake up in the middle of the night&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with ideas&#x2026;always throwing off sparks.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I remember he even did it&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;on our honeymoon.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Chuckles]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Funny thing is that Ken
didn't even talk about the books&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
unless he was on television.
</p>

<p>
This the truck's gonna move my stuff
outta suite 803?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
You almost finished?
Haven't started.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do you mean,</li>
</ul>
<p>
you haven't started?
</p>

<li>I'm only the driver, mister.</li>

<p>

They've been in there a half an hour already.
</p>

<p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Oh.
Hiya, Mr. Franklin.
</p>

<p>
Just finishing up
this last Melville mystery.
I didn't get a chance the other day.
</p>

<p>
All right.
Now, what are you doir here?
</p>

<p>
Why, I'm waiting for you.
I happened to be in the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
You're always in the neighborhood!
</p>

<p>
Can you tell me what right you've got
to keep those movers out of this office?
</p>

<p>
Oh, listen, I'm sorry about that.
It's just&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
You know what I thought?
I thought you and I should talk alone.
</p>

<p>
You and I have nothing to talk about.
Yes, we do, Mr. Franklin.
We have somethir to talk about.
</p>

<p>
I'm here to arrest ya
for the murder of your partner.
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
Now, it's my duty to inform you
of your Constitutional rights&#x2026;
Oh, will you cut that drivel?
</p>

<p>
I've written
that stuff so many times,
I know it by heart.
</p>

<p>
And what is this nonsense,
&lt;i&gt;you're&lt;/i&gt; gonna arrest &lt;i&gt;me?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Come on, Mr. Franklin.
Why don't you make a statement
and save us both a lot of trouble?
</p>

<p>
You know, I've really got ya.
</p>

<p>
All right, Lieutenant. You got me.
I'm your prisoner. Here.
</p>

<p>
Clamp the irons on me.
</p>

<p>
Do you wanna give me a dime first,
so I can phone my attorney?
</p>

<p>
Because I promise you, I'm gonna
sue you and your department&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
for false arrest
and defamation of character.
</p>

<p>
I kinda knew it
right from the start.
</p>

<p>
It was nothing definite.
It was a lot of little things.
</p>

<p>
Little things&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
driving back from San Diego
on the day of the murder
instead of taking a plane,
</p>

<p>
the open mail, never showing
any genuine emotion for a man
that you worked with for ten years&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
[Laughs]
With that, you know
what they're gonna do?
</p>

<p>
They're gonna laugh you
right outta court.
</p>

<p>
But they're not gonna laugh
at the insurance policy, are they?
</p>

<p>
I've got a photostatic copy of it
here in my pocket.
</p>

<p>
They gonna laugh at the fact that you
withdrew $15,000, put it back the next day?
</p>

<p>
I've got the book that you gave
to Miss La Sanka with your signature in it.
</p>

<p>
You expect to get
a true bill of indictment
on that&#x2026; trivia?
</p>

<p>
Come on, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
I was down in San Diego.
So was your partner.
</p>

<p>
That's a provocative statement.
Can you prove that?
</p>

<p>
Yes.
</p>

<p>
Not with the witness,
'cause you killed the witness.
But I got another way to prove it.
</p>

<p>
Well, you enlighten me.
I must say, I enjoy watching a man raise
without any cards in his hand.
</p>

<p>
You know what, Ken?
I'm gonna tell you the truth.
</p>

<p>
For a while there,
I never thought I was gonna get you.
</p>

<p>
Believe me,
you had me goir in such circles.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't figure it out.
Suddenly, I thought of something&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
how clever that first murder was&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
the phone gimmick,
working late in the office.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Brilliant.&lt;/i&gt;
Oh, are you awarding gold medals today?
</p>

<p>
Yes! For the first one,
not for the second one.
That was sloppy.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Melville,
she'd have been very disappointed.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Oh, come on, get&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to the climax, Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You're talking to a writer.
&lt;i&gt;Am I?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That's not what I heard.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
And that's the key:
That you're not a writer.
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Ferris told me
that you didn't contribute to the writing,
</p>

<p>
that her husband did all the work,
</p>

<p>
That's a lie.
I had to say to myself,
</p>

<p>
'How could a man
with no talent for mysteries
make up such a clever murder?"
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;If you were that ingenious,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you'd be able to write your own books.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Go ahead. I'm fascinated,
as boring as it may be.
</p>

<p>
Then I got it.
</p>

<p>
The first one&#x2026; the clever one&#x2026;
that wasn't yours.
</p>

<p>
The second one&#x2026;
the sloppy one&#x2026; that was yours.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But not the first.</li>
<li>Oh?</li>
</ul>

<p>
And whose idea was that, then?
</p>

<p>
Your partner's. Had to be.
</p>

<p>
And his wife told me
how conscientious he was.
</p>

<p>
You know, the way he used to write down
his ideas on every odd scrap of paper,
backs of matches, whatever&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Ahh, ah. So that's why
you wouldn't let the movers in.
</p>

<p>
Well, I had to rummage around here
before they emptied everything out.
</p>

<p>
Is this
your partner's handwriting?
</p>

<p>
Well, I think I can prove it is.
Maybe I ought to read this to ya.
</p>

<p>

'and has him call his wife in city.

at the office. Bang, bang."
</p>

<p>
Sound familiar?
That's the part you used,
</p>

<p>
practically word-for-word.
</p>

<p>
Should I read some more?
</p>

<p>
No.

</p>

<p>
With this, I think I got
a conviction, don't you?
</p>

<p>
You got to admit I had you goir
for awhile though, didn't I?
</p>

<p>
Yes, you did.
</p>

<p>
[Snickers]
You wanna know the irony
of all of this?
</p>

<p>
That &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; my idea,

<p>

I ever had.
</p>

<p>
I must've told it toJim
over five years ago.

would write it down?

Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
I assume our guest has arrived.
Yes, sir, but Mr. Kennicutt
isn't hear yet.
</p>

<p>
Well, he's not due
for another 30 seconds.
</p>

<p>
He's just coming in now.
</p>

<p>
I want you to listen
very carefully, please.
</p>

<p>
My name is Arthur Kennicutt.
Mr. Brimmer's expecting me.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes, sir.
Would you go right in, please?
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Oh, Mr. Kennicutt.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You're right on time.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Would you care
for something to drink?
Oh. Some coffee, black.
</p>

<p>
I was just reading
one of your papers.
</p>

<p>
I see you've taken a stand
on this federal judgeship
that's giving everybody fits.
</p>

<p>
I'd rather not talk politics right now,
Mr. Brimmer, if you don't mind.
</p>

<p>
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Henry.
</p>

<p>
Well, this is your wife's file,
Mr. Kennicutt,
</p>

<p>
and the fact sheet
shows five weeks now
of intensive surveillance.
</p>

<p>
All movement, personal contact,
telephone communications.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It's really quite extensive.&lt;/i&gt;
And?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kennicutt,
you have nothing to worry about.
It's a clean bill of health.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You sure?</li>
<li>Well, I'm not in the habit</li>
</ul>
<p>
of making mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Yes. I'm sorry, of course.
</p>

<p>
But lately it's been like
waiting for a biopsy report&#x2026;
benign or malignant.
</p>

<p>
Well, in this case, benign.
</p>

<p>
I don't know which I feel most,
relief or anger.
</p>

<p>
Anger?
&lt;i&gt;At myself&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;my idiotic suspicions.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
But I suppose when one marries
a much younger woman,
</p>

<p>
one tends to become
a little paranoid.
</p>

<p>
[Brimmer]
Well, sometimes there's good cause.
In this case, not.
</p>

<p>
Read it at your leisure.
There's not a hint of another man.
</p>

<p>
You know, it's funny.
</p>

<p>
I love her.
I love her very much.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And I think I know her.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;But lately I could have sworn that&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Well, it doesn't matter now.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I feel so guilty, I'm going to&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;start showering her with gifts.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
She won't know what hit her.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Mr. Brimmer,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I owe you a great deal.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, it's a pleasure
to set your mind at rest, sir.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
And you'll have my check
in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Very kind of you.
&lt;i&gt;Thank you again.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Could you hear everything?
&lt;i&gt;[Woman]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Yes.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Well, you seem confused.</li>
<li>Well, I don't know why</li>
</ul>
<p>
you asked me to come here.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I thought it was obvious.</li>
<li>No, not really.</li>

<li>You&#x2026;</li>
<li>What you're trying to say</li>
</ul>
<p>
is that I lied to your husband.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's correct,
Mrs. Kennicutt.
</p>

<p>
I even went so far
as to falsify the report.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Would you like a glass of water?</li>
<li>No. Uh, nothing, thank you.</li>
</ul>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;In point of fact,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
you were having an affair.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;The mars name was Archer.&lt;/i&gt;
It's over, Mr. Brimmer.
</p>

<p>
But I'm sure you already know that.
</p>

<p>
It was a mistake.
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
A stupid mistake.
</p>

<p>
But I ended it.
</p>

<p>
And it won't ever happen again.
</p>

<p>
Why didn't you
tell my husband the truth?
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
Oddly enough, Mrs. Kennicutt,
</p>

<p>
I am a moralist&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
a vanishing species,
so I'm told.
</p>

<p>
A thousand broken marriages
come across my desk&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
infidelities,
uh, domestic deceit.
</p>

<p>
In your case,
10 years of marriage&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and one brief indiscretion.
</p>

<p>
So, why not bend the truth
a little bit?
</p>

<p>
Uh, then you're
not going to tell him?
</p>

<p>
I haven't and I won't.
File's closed.
</p>

<p>
[Exhales Deeply]
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Thank you, Mr. Brimmer.
</p>

<p>
I am so grateful.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;How grateful?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kennicutt,
</p>

<p>
a detective agency
runs on information.
</p>

<p>
That's our raw material.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Your husband&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;owns three newspapers,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
two on this coast
and one on the East.
</p>

<p>
Whenever anything happens
on the inside of business or politics
or even in the jet-set&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I still don't understand how I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Information, Mrs. Kennicutt.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
It is our only stock in trade.
</p>

<p>
For example,
at the moment I'm working on case&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
wherein it would be
very beneficial to my client&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
to have certain information
about a federal judge
that your husband is supporting.
</p>

<p>
Are you saying that you want me
to be a pipeline to my husband?
</p>

<p>
No. Just [Sighs]
A good listener.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Is it really asking so much,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mrs. Kennicutt?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I can't do this kind of work alone.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I need that kind of help.
</p>

<p>
Why don't you think about it
and we'll talk again.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Ice Cubes Jingling]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Your terrace door was unlocked,
so I trespassed.
</p>

<p>
Well, there's no car in the front.
</p>

<p>
Oh. I thought you knew everything,
Mr. Brimmer. We're neighbors.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;My husband and I have a weekend house&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;about three miles from here.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Ironic, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
Why are you here?
</p>

<p>
Well, why else?
To discuss your&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
What shall we call it?
Your proposition.
</p>

<p>
I've been walking on the beach
for hours, thinking.
</p>

<p>
And you've come to a decision.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes.
</p>

<p>
Tell me something,
Mr. Brimmer.
</p>

<p>
How many other rich mers wives
owe you favors?
</p>

<p>
Do they all capitulate easily?
</p>

<p>
I'm waiting
for your answer.
</p>

<p>
Oh, indulge me.
</p>

<p>
I should think
the blackmail-ee
has some right.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kennicutt, I r&#x2026;
The answer is no.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No deal.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Is that plain enough for you?
If you want a spy,
you find someone else.
</p>

<p>
All right.
</p>

<p>
I'll have to call your husband
in the morning and&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
And what?
Tell him I had an affair?
</p>

<p>
Sorry. It won't work.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I'm going to tell him myself.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I can't believe
that you'd want to do that.
</p>

<p>
Well, what you believe
really doesn't matter, does it?
</p>

<p>
It's what Arthur thinks
that's important.
</p>

<p>
Maybe he'll ask for a divorce
or maybe he'll forgive me.
</p>

<p>
But it's time
I was honest with him.
</p>

<p>
You're being very foolish.
</p>

<p>
Only if I lose.
</p>

<p>
But you can't threaten me
anymore, can you?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You just lost your leverage.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, and one other thing.
</p>

<p>
I'm also going to tell him
about the way you run your business.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't advise that.
Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't.
</p>

<p>
Because whether he forgives me or not,
he's gonna despise you for lying to him.
</p>

<p>
And Arthur's not the right man
to have for an enemy.
</p>

<p>
Good night, Mr. Brimmer.
Mrs. Kennicutt,
I want you to reconsider.
</p>

<p>
Your husband
has some very powerful friends.
</p>

<p>
[Chortles]
That's right.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you'll please excuse me.
</p>

<p>
I cannot permit you to do that.
Well, you don't understand.
It's not your choice.
</p>

<p>
You let go of me!
</p>

<p>
Let go!

</p>

<p>
[Siren Dies Out]
</p>

<p>
[Engine Stops]
</p>

<p>
What's the trouble, Officer?
May I see your license
and registration?
</p>

<p>
Turn signal, right?
The right one.
</p>

<p>
You know, it's the second time
I got stopped today.
</p>

<p>
I tell you,
I'll get those things fixed
as soon as I can.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You'll get 'em fixed now.</li>
<li>I would, but I'm on my way</li>
</ul>
<p>
to a 187 P.C.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Say, are you a cop?</li>
<li>Uh, yeah, a lieutenant&#x2026; Columbo.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Well, I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
I flagged you down.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's all right.
You're just doing your job.
Listen, I'll get those things fixed.
</p>

<p>
This license expires next week.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Oh, well, thanks.
</p>

<p>
Say, I better give you an escort.
That way you'll get where you wanna go.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Okay. Appreciate that.
But listen, not too fast.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Police Radio Chatter]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Can't tell for sure,
but I don't think she was killed her.
Looks like the body was moved.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And the cause of death?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Probably a severe concussion.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Print team all wrapped up, Captain.
Nothing.
</p>

<p>
There were two blows.
Uh, send them on home.
</p>

<p>
Laceration on the cheek
and major contusion
at the base of the skull.
</p>

<p>
How do you read that?
It's hard to say.
</p>

<p>
Maybe somebody hit her
and she struck her head
going down.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lieutenant, you got that?</li>
<li>&lt;i&gt;I'll know more about this&lt;/i&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;after the autopsy.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh, yeah. Got a match?
&lt;i&gt;Plus the approximate time of death.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
No.
No tire tracks we can use.
</p>

<p>
Got a match?
I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
</p>

<p>
Oh.
No prints. Just smudges.
</p>

<p>
Money?
Just change. No currency.
</p>

<p>
You got a match.
No, I don't. Sorry.
</p>

<p>
Got a match.
Yeah, sure.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Captain]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We're all finished here.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You can load it up.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Identification and purse.
Mrs. Arthur Kennicutt&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; Arthur Kennicutt.
</p>

<p>
How do you know that?
Credit card's made out
to Kennicutt Publications.
</p>

<p>
What's the problem?
Newspapers.
</p>

<p>
If we don't handle this
according to Kennicutt's
satisfaction,
</p>

<p>
he's got an awful lot of front pages
to beat us over the head with.
</p>

<p>
Thought I told you
to move that out of here.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
what are you looking at?
</p>

<p>
The bruise, sir.
The lady has a bruise
on the left cheek.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;We know that.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I knew
you werert listening.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Police Radio Chatter Continues]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
It's Lenore.
I wanna get out of here.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Thank you, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Would you like to be alone
for a few moments?
</p>

<p>
No, no. I can feel sorry for myself
some other time,
</p>

<p>
after you've caught him.
</p>

<p>
Well, should we get down
to business?
</p>

<p>
Are you sure
there's nothing else you want?
</p>

<p>
As the husband,
I'm the most likely suspect, correct?
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026;
&lt;i&gt;You don't have to worry&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;about my feelings, Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;She was killed last night.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;What time?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Between 8:00 and 9:00.
</p>

<p>
Well, I was in San Francisco
addressing a conference.
</p>

<p>
I didn't fly back
until this morning.
</p>

<p>
Uh, you have
the flight numbers on that?
</p>

<p>
My secretary can give them to you,
</p>

<p>
together with my hotel
and my schedule.
</p>

<p>
You'll check them all out, naturally.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir.
&lt;i&gt;And when you do,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you'll dismiss me as a possibility&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;and then get down to the real business&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of finding the real killer.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
And I want him found, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Soon.&lt;/i&gt;
I'll do my best.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure you will.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Mr. Kennicutt, it would help
if you could tell us a few things.
</p>

<p>
Did your wife
have any enemies?
</p>

<p>
Lenore never offended a soul.
</p>

<p>
She was an extraordinary woman.
</p>

<p>
I see. This question is a bit awkward,
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask it&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
was there ever, uh,
another man in her life?
</p>

<p>
Naturally. More than one.
</p>

<p>
But that was years ago,
before we were married.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No, sir.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I meant since you were married.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You're speaking of an affair?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Well, I'm afraid we're gonna
have to consider it.
</p>

<p>
Well, don't bother.
Lenore was faithful to me in every way.
</p>

<p>
She had a clean bill of health.
</p>

<p>
All right. Clean bill of health.
</p>

<p>
So you don't think
we ought to go in that direction?
</p>

<p>
No, I don't.
</p>

<p>
All right.
Can you tell us about her habits?
What did she do in her spare time?
</p>

<p>
Nothing unusual.
</p>

<p>
Shopping, charity work.
</p>

<p>
Sports.
Sports. What kind of sports
did she play?
</p>

<p>
Oh, tennis. She was also
very fond of skin diving.
</p>

<p>
Yes. Uh, did she do this with you, sir?
Did she do it with friends?
</p>

<p>
With friends, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Female friends,
in case you're wondering.
</p>

<p>
Female friends.
</p>

<p>
All right, sir.
I think I've got enough to start with.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
</p>

<p>
I want you
to understand something.
</p>

<p>
I married a woman
young enough to be my daughter.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;A lot of people were skeptical,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;but it worked for us.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
We loved each other.
We loved each other very much.
</p>

<p>
We even thought of having a child.
</p>

<p>
I want this man caught.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And I must warn you,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I don't intend to be patient.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Lieutenant.
Thanks for the coffee.
</p>

<p>
You're welcome, sir.
</p>

<p>
Good morning, Lieutenant.
Good morning, sir.
</p>

<p>
Would you like some coffee,
some juice?
Uh, nothing for me.
</p>

<p>
No. Thank you very much.
Any progress?
</p>

<p>
Uh, no, sir.
I hate to admit this,
but, uh, nothing.
</p>

<p>
Not a single lead?
No, sir. Nothing.
</p>

<p>
Well, uh&#x2026; Well,
some of my associates think&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that, uh, your wife was mugged
and the fella ran away with the money.
</p>

<p>
But, um, you see,
they can't really explain
how the body was moved.
</p>

<p>
And, uh, now, me, I don't know.
</p>

<p>
I, uh&#x2026; I think
she knew the murderer.
</p>

<p>
Why? Excuse me.
[Ringing]
</p>

<p>
Yes.
</p>

<p>
Yes?
</p>

<p>
All right. Be right in.
</p>

<p>
Why?
Well, her behavior seems
a little strange, sir.
</p>

<p>
Uh, she went out to the beach house
in the middle of the week,
which is unusual.
</p>

<p>
And, uh, she said to the caretaker
she had some thinking to do&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and then she went for a walk.
</p>

<p>
And then the next morning her body
was found on the other side of town.
</p>

<p>
What are you getting at?
</p>

<p>
I wish I knew.
I don't know.
</p>

<p>
It's just that it sounds to me
like a woman that has a problem.
</p>

<p>
Now, did your wife
have any personal problems?
My wife was a very happy woman.
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh. Yeah, well,
</p>

<p>
it's just that
if she did have a problem,
</p>

<p>
I thought that maybe it would be
connected with the murder.
</p>

<p>
But you've no proof of that.
Oh, no, sir. No.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I call the City Room
every half hour to find out
what you people are doing.
</p>

<p>
So far, not a word.
</p>

<p>
No arrest&#x2026;
not even a promise of one.
</p>

<p>
Now you tell me
you haven't a lead.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Kennicutt.
Uh, looks like it's gonna be slow.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't have to be.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant Columbo,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;this is Mr. Brimmer.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
How do you do?
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
You've heard of
Brimmer Associates?
Uh, no, I haven't.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's security
and investigations,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
You might say you and I
are in the same business.
</p>

<p>
Oh, really?
Matter of fact,
I was talking about you just last night.
</p>

<p>
I ran into the commissioner
at a party.
</p>

<p>
He speaks
very highly of you.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, you're wondering
why Mr. Brimmer's here.
</p>

<p>
Now, please don't take this
as a reflection on you,
</p>

<p>
but I've engaged his firm
to work on the case.
</p>

<p>
Well, now, Arthur,
I'm here in an advisory capacity&#x2026;
a supplemental capacity only.
</p>

<p>
I don't want
the lieutenant to get the idea
that I'm competing with him.
</p>

<p>
Uh, but there's no reason
why a private agency
and a public one&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
can't cooperate,
is there?
No.
</p>

<p>
You see,
I want as much coverage
in this case as possible.
</p>

<p>
And when Mr. Brimmer called
and offered his services,
</p>

<p>
I thought it was an excellent idea.
</p>

<p>
Sure, uh,
I can understand that.
</p>

<p>
Uh, you two know
each other?
</p>

<p>
Well, Mr. Brimmer's done
some work for me.
</p>

<p>
I see. I see.
[Clears Throat]
</p>

<p>
Some kind of security work?
Guards for the paper?
</p>

<p>
Oh, it was a personal matter.
The point is, Lieutenant,
</p>

<p>
I told Arthur on the phone
I couldn't imagine you wouldn't
accept a helping hand&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
considering the manpower shortage
in your department.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You see, Mr. Brimmer&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;used to be a police officer himself.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Brimmer]
Well, it was a long time ago.
</p>

<p>
But at least I can understand
your problems, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Well, now, listen,
I said to Mr. Kennicutt I'm grateful
for all the help I can get.
</p>

<p>
I'm just not sure
how my superior's gonna take this.
</p>

<p>
That's already been taken care of.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It's just that Mr. Kennicutt is anxious&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;for a quick resolution to the case.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You can understand that.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, naturally.
&lt;i&gt;[Brimmer]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Well, good.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I hope the association
will be beneficial to you.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm sure it will. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
You know, I suddenly feel
very much more optimistic
about this whole thing.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Uh, it's not based on anything,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;no facts, but,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
you know,
I'm a superstitious guy.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You know, I believe in signs.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I believe in palmistry and astrology&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and all that kinda thing.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You don't, I know that.
&lt;i&gt;Oh, definitely not.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Let me see your hand.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You see, Mr. Kennicutt,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that's your fate line&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and it breaks there.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
That was your bad fortune.
</p>

<p>
But it picks up again,
and that's interesting.
</p>

<p>
That's a very good omen.
</p>

<p>
May I?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Mmm.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Deep line of Apollo.
</p>

<p>
That's a man devoted to his work.
</p>

<p>
Your Apollo line
crosses the mound of the Moon.
You know, that's very rare.
</p>

<p>
And very impressive.
</p>

<p>
That's the sign of a man
who's destined to attain
a very particular kind of distinction.
</p>

<p>
That's a very good sign.
</p>

<p>
I know you think it's silly,
</p>

<p>
but I'm gonna make a believer
out of you before I'm done.
</p>

<p>
It was very nice meeting you.
Nice to have met you.
</p>

<p>
Bye-bye.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mr. Brimmer.
Large thumb, low mound of Venus.
</p>

<p>
That means ambition,
purposefulness.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;That's a closet, Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
Oh, gee. I'm sorry.
</p>

<p>
A lot of people
make the same mistake.
</p>

<p>
Say, that's a terrific-looking
set of clubs. Do you mind?
</p>

<p>
Go ahead.
</p>

<p>
These seem light.
Are these ladies' clubs?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They were Lenore's.</li>
<li>You didn't say she played golf,</li>
</ul>
<p>
did you?
</p>

<p>
You mentioned tennis
and skin diving.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That's because she just started.</li>
<li>Ahh. I see. Where'd she play?</li>
</ul>

<p>
At the country club.
&lt;i&gt;I see. At the club.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, I was just wondering&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;why shejust didn't keep her clubs&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in the locker room?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;She did.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That's an extra set&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;she used to take lessons with.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, I see.
Well, that explains it. Right.
</p>

<p>
Uh, you mean
she didn't take lessons at her own club?
She took them someplace else?
</p>

<p>
Sky Lane.
Why, is it important?
</p>

<p>
It's not important. It's just I like to
get that background information
very precise if I can.
</p>

<p>
Bye.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is this the right door?</li>
<li>[Chuckles] Yes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Well, what was that
all about?
</p>

<p>
Well, I think, uh, police techniques
have changed a little over the years.
</p>

<p>
Here, try it again.
</p>

<p>
And remember, keep the back
of your left hand straight.
</p>

<p>
None of this.
Just stroke it easy, all right?
</p>

<p>
Oh, that was good.
You're getting better.
</p>

<p>
Well, I still don't think
I'm ever gonna learn this game.
</p>

<p>
Oh, you just have to
keep your eye on the ball,
watch your concentration.
</p>

<p>
You're coming along fine.
</p>

<p>
Do we have time
for another bucket?
</p>

<p>
Sorry, Jenny. Time's up.
Tomorrow, 3:00.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow then.
</p>

<p>
You a member of the club?
</p>

<p>
Uh, no. No, I'm,
uh, Lieutenant Columbo.
I'm from the police.
</p>

<p>
[Mumbles]
</p>

<p>
What's the problem?
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about a Lenore Kennicutt.
</p>

<p>
Uh, you knew her?
</p>

<p>
Not very well.
</p>

<p>
I gave her a few lessons.
</p>

<p>
I see. Uh, well, this is
your appointment book, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
Well, you should know.
You've been looking at it.
</p>

<p>
Well, no offense.
I was just killing time.
</p>

<p>
But, uh, you know,
now that you mention it,
</p>

<p>
I see that you gave her
a lot of lessons.
</p>

<p>
She liked the game.
I see.
</p>

<p>
Well, look here's the thing.
Um, since you spent a lot of time
with her,
</p>

<p>
I was wondering if you could
give me some help.
</p>

<p>
How?
Was she the type of woman&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
now this is just between
you and me&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
was she the type of woman
who was on the lookout?
</p>

<p>
I mean, did you ever notice her
give her eye to any of the men
around here?
</p>

<p>
Uh, look, Lieutenant.
We better get one thing straight.
</p>

<p>
I teach them golf
and I play in their tournaments,
</p>

<p>
but I don't get involved
in their personal lives.
</p>

<p>
If they wanna pair off,
that's none of my business.
</p>

<p>
Okay. All right.
Uh, well, thanks a lot.
</p>

<p>
It's quite all right.
Take it easy.
</p>

<p>
Uh, say, uh,
</p>

<p>
what kind of club is this?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Oh, that's a number one wood.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Number one wood.
</p>

<p>
Listen, uh, could you
give me a lesson?
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
No, I'm serious.
You know what my trouble is?
</p>

<p>
I work too hard.
Never out of the office.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I figure this:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If I could take up a sport,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
get out in the fresh air
and get some exercise,
</p>

<p>
that'd do me some good.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do you say?</li>
<li>Well, I&#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Just for a few minutes.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Just to, you know, start to swing.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Come on.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Say, you know what was a funny thing
about your appointments
with Mrs. Kennicutt?
</p>

<p>
Uh, the first two
were in the morning&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and all the rest,
and I counted 13 of them,
</p>

<p>
uh, they were always in the middle
or the late afternoon.
</p>

<p>
So?
Uh, well,
I guess it's not important.
</p>

<p>
I guess it's nothing.
Uh, wait a minute.
I'll take off my coat.
</p>

<p>
Except that, uh,
</p>

<p>
now, every time
you had an appointment
with Mrs. Kennicutt,
</p>

<p>
it was always
the last lesson of the day.
</p>

<p>
I like to finish
at a reasonable hour.
Doesn't everyone?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I see.
So those days, you left the club.
</p>

<p>
I thought maybe you'd hang around to
see if you could pick up an odd lesson.
</p>

<p>
Well, I didn't always go home.
</p>

<p>
Oh, who said anything
about going home?
</p>

<p>
Oh. What I mean is I didn't always
leave the club. Sometimes&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Hey, listen.
Can I help you out?
</p>

<p>
Don't say anything else.
You don't have an attorney.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Wait until you get an attorney.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This way you can hurt your case.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Believe me,
I know something about my business.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I don't know nothing about golf,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you know. See that's your business.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I know something about my business.
</p>

<p>
And believe me, you know,
down through the years, uh,
</p>

<p>
you get so that you develop
a nose for things, you see?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And,&lt;/i&gt; uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
After a while, the old nose
just tells you when someone's
not giving you the truth.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Now, uh,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I'm gonna forget about the lesson,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;'cause I could never learn this game,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
but I'll be back to talk to you.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Ground covered by the police&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;is not our concern.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
One thing to bear in mind,
money was taken.
</p>

<p>
Granted, it could have
been a smoke screen,
</p>

<p>
but sometimes the obvious answer
is the correct one.
</p>

<p>
Now, Brooks&#x2026;
Yes, sir?
</p>

<p>
Check into her banking account
with particular attention to withdrawals.
</p>

<p>
See if you can find out how much cash
she was carrying that day.
Mr. Kennicutt will be glad to cooperate.
</p>

<p>
Now, my theory, gentlemen,
and you will gear your efforts
in this direction,
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kennicutt was walking
along the Pacific Coast Highway.
</p>

<p>
She was forced into a car&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
by someone.
</p>

<p>
The motive was robbery.
</p>

<p>
She probably fought back.
In any case, she was killed.
</p>

<p>
The murderer drove around
in a panic&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and finally all the way out to here,
where he got rid of the body.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Intercom Buzzer]&lt;/i&gt;
Yes?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Woman]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant Columbo to see you.&lt;/i&gt;
Who?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes.
Yes, send him in.
</p>

<p>
Gentlemen, we'll finish this later.
I'll call you. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant!
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Come in!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Whew! Boy.
This is quite a building.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;This all yours?&lt;/i&gt;
'Fraid so.
</p>

<p>
Must be a lot of business
for your kinda company these days.
Well, we can't handle it all.
</p>

<p>
Sit down.
Uh, listen, your secretary called.
</p>

<p>
She said you wanted to see the files
on the case, so I thought it'd be a lot
safer if I brought 'em over myself.
</p>

<p>
Oh. That's very nice of you.
It wasn't necessary,
but I appreciate it very much.
</p>

<p>
Uh, want some coffee?
No. No, thanks.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
Uh, those are the duplicates.
</p>

<p>
Okay.
</p>

<p>
Yes, this will help.
</p>

<p>
A lot of it. I wonder if you can
give me a little rundown.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's just what I told
Mr. Kennicutt.
</p>

<p>
No leads. Except, you know,
I was looking through that stuff
last night.
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm.
</p>

<p>
And, uh, drives my wife crazy,
you know.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Because we have the lamp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;right next to the bed,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and the poor thing, she can't sleep.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Did you find anything?
</p>

<p>
No, not really. Well, uh,
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;take the autopsy report.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yes. Here it is.
</p>

<p>
You see now,
that jibed with something
that I noticed about the body&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
the first time I saw it,
and that bothered me.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kennicutt
was struck on the left cheek,
and she had a bruise.
</p>

<p>
And she had a weird kinda cut.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Um&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Do you see what I mean?
</p>

<p>
Um, no. I don't think so.
</p>

<p>
Well, let's start with the cut,
because that's what bothered me.
</p>

<p>
I said to myself,
'Now what in the world
could have caused that kind of cut?"
</p>

<p>
Uh, does this lighter work?
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I think so.
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Uh, wh&#x2026; where was I?
About the cut.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes.
What could have caused the cut?
</p>

<p>
I said to myself, ' It could be a ring."
</p>

<p>
A ring of&#x2026; You mean a finger ring.
This kind of ring.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, something like that.
Now here's the way I figured it.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you were gonna
strike somebody.
</p>

<p>
Suppose it was a woman.
</p>

<p>
Now, do you punch her?
Well, maybe.
</p>

<p>
But more than likely,
you hit with your open hand.
</p>

<p>
Either this way or this way.
Mm-hmm.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you hit this way,
then the ring is not gonna
cause any cut.
</p>

<p>
So I figured it was
a backhand blow like this.
All right?
</p>

<p>
I still don't follow you too well,
because that would, uh,
that would put it over on&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But I used my right hand,
you see?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
And if the ring was on the right hand,
then the bruise would be
on the right cheek.
</p>

<p>
But it was on the left cheek,
so the murderer was left-handed.
</p>

<p>
Struck her like this.
</p>

<p>
Which means
the murderer is left-handed.
Well, that's interesting.
</p>

<p>
That's provided, of course,
all these, uh, speculations are valid.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I would say that
we have a left-handed murderer,
</p>

<p>
and, uh,
and an unpremeditated crime.
</p>

<p>
We have?
&lt;i&gt;Oh, I think so, yes.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I mean, I don't think
a man kills with his hands
unless he's angry.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;As a matter of fact, you know,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;maybe he didn't mean to do it.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Could be.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You know,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;maybe it was an accident.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You know, I got a feeling
that when we find our friend,
</p>

<p>
it's gonna turn out
that he has a terrible temper.
</p>

<p>
Hmm.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, maybe you're right.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I certainly wish I had your crystal ball,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Why don't you let me
digest this material,
and then we'll talk again.
</p>

<p>
Okay. All right. Fine.
</p>

<p>
Sure. Listen.
I want to thank you
for the time.
</p>

<p>
Listen. Thank you.
Right.
</p>

<p>
Oh, listen,
before I forget, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Gee whiz.
</p>

<p>
I didn't wanna forget that.
</p>

<p>
But, uh, let's see.
</p>

<p>
I had a receipt here
that I wanted you to sign.
</p>

<p>
Well, listen,
let's just make one up.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It's a receipt&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;for the files.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Isn't that weird?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What a coincidence.</li>
<li>What's that?</li>
</ul>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Here, a moment ago, we were&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;talking about left-handed people,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and you're left-handed.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
And right-handed.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I'm ambidextrous.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
That means I don't favor
either hand particularly.
</p>

<p>
It's a character trait shared
by about 10% of the world's population.
</p>

<p>
Ten percent?
No kidding?
</p>

<p>
Anything else?
Uh, no.
</p>

<p>
No, I don't think so. Uh, oh, listen.
This is a little bit off the subject.
</p>

<p>
My sister-in-law, she wants to
buy a place out at the beach.
How do you like it out there?
</p>

<p>
Who told you I was living
out at the beach?
Well, no one.
</p>

<p>
L&#x2026; I noticed your car
out in front of Mr. Kennicutt's.
</p>

<p>
You know, you parked it there
in the driveway.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;As I was walking by,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I saw the chrome was tarnished.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You know what the salt air does to it.
It just eats the life out of it.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, that part's a problem, all right.
</p>

<p>
Uh, you're a very observant man,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
That's not what my wife says.
&lt;i&gt;[Laughs]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, you tell your sister-in-law
that she will love it at the beach&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
if she doesn't mind that problem
with the salt air on the chrome.
</p>

<p>
I'll give her that message.
And thanks again.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Oh, uh, say.
</p>

<p>
Have you ever been
in Mr. Kennicutt's house?
</p>

<p>
Yes, I met you there.
</p>

<p>
No, I didn't mean the big house.
I meant out at the beach.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I was just wondering, because&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;your beach house and his beach house,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;they're fairly close, aren't they?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
No. It's a couple miles.
</p>

<p>
That close?
Tsk. Isn't that a coincidence?
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I'll tell you,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;this case is just full of'em.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Door Closes]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
Why don't you and I take a walk?
</p>

<p>
When you showed up today,
I&#x2026; I kinda panicked.
</p>

<p>
Then you did have
an affair with her?
</p>

<p>
Turning on the ladies
is about the only thing
I do well.
</p>

<p>
I'm not a very good golfer.
Yeah, go on.
</p>

<p>
Well, it was pretty good
for a while&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
at least for me.
</p>

<p>
She got the guilts.
</p>

<p>
Funny thing, I think
she really loved her husband.
</p>

<p>
One day she said,
'Ken, this is bad for both of us.
Let's call it off." So we did.
</p>

<p>
Must have shook you up
when we found her dead.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't believe it.
</p>

<p>
Then I got to thinking,
sooner or later, you guys
would find out about me.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Maybe even think&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I killed her.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;The night she died, I was&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I was home watching the tube.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
No calls. No company.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No alibi. That's&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That's why I started to run.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh.
I can understand that.
</p>

<p>
You didn't kill her.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No, no.&lt;/i&gt;
I know that, but this afternoon,
you gave me the impression&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
No. You're in the clear.
You got nothing to worry about.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You see, whoever did this,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;he had to wear a ring.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Now, you don't wear a ring.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, I could have taken it off.
</p>

<p>
No, not with that tan,
because that would show.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Now listen.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Tell me something.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kennicutt&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Did Mrs. Kennicutt
ever indicate to you&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that she was concerned
that her husband knew
about you two?
</p>

<p>
No.
</p>

<p>
That's funny that you
mention it though,
</p>

<p>
because, well,
I was concerned.
</p>

<p>
Why?
</p>

<p>
Well, Lenore never saw anyone,
but I'm sure we were being followed.
</p>

<p>
By who?
</p>

<p>
Well, there was
this one guy in particular.
</p>

<p>
Sharp, well-dressed.
I only caught him in flashes, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Well, he&#x2026; he had a crew cut.
Kind of an ex-marine type.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Telephone Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Yes?</li>
<li>Wilcox, Mr. Brimmer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The subject is meeting with Archer,
and they've engaged in conversation.
</p>

<p>
Did you overhear anything?
</p>

<p>
No, sir. But Archer seems to
be doing most of the talking.
</p>

<p>
Maintain the surveillance
and report to me in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Phone Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
Why, you little bum, you.
</p>

<p>
Hello?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes, he is. Leo.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Mr. Brimmer.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Yes, sir?</li>
<li>I'm sorry to trouble you at home, Leo.</li>
</ul>

<p>
No sweat.
Just playing with Teddy.
</p>

<p>
Well, I've got a little something
I want you to do for me. It may
complicate your life a little bit.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When?</li>
<li>Immediately.</li>

<li>Set it up through my secretary.</li>
<li>Yes, sir. I'll be in touch.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every one of our operatives
is a skilled marksman.
</p>

<p>
Actually, our policy
is to avoid the use of the weapon.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;This is our memory bank,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Millions ofbits&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of information,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
all cross-filed and on tape,
immediately available.
</p>

<p>
There are more electrical impulses
in this room than in your brain.
</p>

<p>
Hard to believe.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
We here at Brimmer Associates
use the most up-to-date equipment.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Years ahead of what you use&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;at police headquarters.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Company cars&#x2026;
custom designed for us.
</p>

<p>
Most of them with telephonic
or radio communication.
</p>

<p>
Phew! It's very impressive.
</p>

<p>
Oh, uh, just one moment,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
One other thing
that might interest you.
</p>

<p>
If you'll just move
past this gate.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's not working.</li>
<li>Well, it has to be.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You're carrying a gun,
aren't you, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
No.
No? Oh.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, that explains&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the malfunction.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Look here. A special system
is built into the gate.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you had a gun,
it would have registered.
</p>

<p>
It's just like out at the airport.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It's a security precaution.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Not that we expect our clients
to be carrying concealed weapons,
but, uh,
</p>

<p>
well, there have been
a few exceptions.
</p>

<p>
Really?
Well, a guy came in here
just about a month ago.
</p>

<p>
Harmless looking.
An accountant
for Mid-Century Oil.
</p>

<p>
We were doing
a company audit.
&lt;i&gt;[Brimmer] Mr. Denning?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I asked you to show
the lieutenant around.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I did not suggest that you discuss&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;our confidential matters&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;with anyone at anytime!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Our clients pay us to be discreet.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Won't you come in, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Sorry about the outburst,
but my people have got to learn.
</p>

<p>
This is a business of trust.
I can't have them gossiping
about the clients.
</p>

<p>
Thank you, Henry.
</p>

<p>
Hope you'll have lunch with me.
Like quenelle of sole?
</p>

<p>
Uh, well, if it's fish,
I like fish. I love fish.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, it's fish.
Drop your coat and dig in.
</p>

<p>
On the Kennicutt case,
my men have come up
with an interesting lead.
</p>

<p>
There were two derelicts
seen in the area.
</p>

<p>
I have their description.
I sent them over to your office,
copies.
</p>

<p>
Right.
Uh, I'll have that checked out.
</p>

<p>
Anything new on your end?
</p>

<p>
Uh, oh, yeah.
Yeah, we got a couple of things.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It seems as though Mrs. Kennicutt&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;was having an affair, you see?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Boy, this is delicious.
How do you make this stuff?
</p>

<p>
I'll have a recipe sent over to you.
You were saying?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah.
Uh, it seems as though&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kennicutt, uh,
she was having an affair.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And,&lt;/i&gt; uh&#x2026;
Oh?
</p>

<p>
And, uh&#x2026;
Oh, listen, when you send the recipe,
would you send it to the house?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don't send it to the office.</li>
<li>Yes, I'll send it to your house.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yeah, she was having an affair
with some golf pro at some country club.
</p>

<p>
And, uh, here's
the interesting thing.
</p>

<p>
Not only
were they having an affair,
</p>

<p>
but it seems as though
they were being watched.
</p>

<p>
Now I got this nutty notion.
</p>

<p>
Suppose Mr. Kennicutt, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you, it's too far-fetched.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it helps to test it out.
Try me.
</p>

<p>
It's really crazy. Well, listen.
It doesn't cost anything.
</p>

<p>
Suppose&#x2026;
Suppose Mr. Kennicutt&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;hired somebody&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to check up on his wife.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And this somebody&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;lied to him.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
He said to Mr. Kennicutt, ' Look.
</p>

<p>
Your wife,
she's got a clean bill of health."
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Now this somebody,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;whoever it is,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;he's in a perfect position&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to blackmail Mrs. Kennicutt.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Now suppose she refuses.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
See? She says,
'No, I'm gonna go tell my husband."
</p>

<p>
Hmm.
I think it's a terrific motive,
don't you?
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, you have
a marvelously convoluted mind.
</p>

<p>
I do?
I like it.
</p>

<p>
The trouble with your theory is,
not only is it very tenuous,
</p>

<p>
but it's impossible to prove,
isn't it?
</p>

<p>
I, uh&#x2026; Oh.
Got a little tomato on that there.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, I said it was nutty.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;What do you think?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You think I oughta drop it, hmm?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Clears Throat]
If you believe in it, stick to it.
</p>

<p>
Run it on down.
</p>

<p>
One other thing
you should keep in mind.
</p>

<p>
Nothing at all to do with the case.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What's that?</li>
<li>Your future.</li>
</ul>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I'd like you to work&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;for Brimmer Associates.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Me?
&lt;i&gt;That's why I had you taken&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;on a V.I.P. Tour.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
We're a growing organization.
You can see that.
</p>

<p>
You'll be a valuable piece
of manpower for us.
</p>

<p>
Oh, boy. You really know
how to toss a curve.
</p>

<p>
No, no, I don't mean it that way.
I'm quite serious.
</p>

<p>
You're a good man, Columbo&#x2026;
up here.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It's time you were thinking&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;about advancement.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;What does&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a lieutenant make?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
If you come with us,
</p>

<p>
I'm almost positive
I can triple your yearly income.
</p>

<p>
Whew! Boy.
I'll tell you, it's all so sudden.
</p>

<p>
Uh, let me talk it over with my wife.
</p>

<p>
Of course talk it over with your wife.
Think about it carefully.
</p>

<p>
But remember,
we want you here.
</p>

<p>
Listen. I'm very flattered.
I mean that.
</p>

<p>
Just let me mull it over a little bit.
</p>

<p>
Well, while you're mulling,
</p>

<p>
consider my career.
</p>

<p>
If I'd stayed with the force,
</p>

<p>
by now,
probably with luck,
</p>

<p>
I could have been
a captain of detectives.
</p>

<p>
Hmm?
With one eye on the promotion list,
and the other eye on my car payments.
</p>

<p>
No house by the ocean.
</p>

<p>
No freedom to travel.
No&#x2026; what would you say?
</p>

<p>
Power or sense of accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
Have I succeeded
in getting through&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
[Clears Throat]
In stimulating you?
</p>

<p>
Definitely. Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I'm gonna give it all
a lot of thought.
</p>

<p>
That's as much as I can ask.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Uh, one thing.&lt;/i&gt;
Hmm?
</p>

<p>
If I came with you, would I still
be working on the Kennicutt case?
</p>

<p>
Well, let's see.
</p>

<p>
I have men who are perfectly capable
of handling the Kennicutt case.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No. I have several other matters&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that are far more important than that&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I'd like to put you on right away.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
to the knock of opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Hey.
Hi.
</p>

<p>
Dry throat for some reason.
Oh, help yourself.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Hey, I hope I didn't
get you into trouble before.
</p>

<p>
I mean, I'm sorry
about what happened.
I'm used to it.
</p>

<p>
Why? Does he blow off
a lot of steam?
</p>

<p>
Well, let's just say
our founding father
has quite a temper.
</p>

<p>
No kidding.
That's funny, because he&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
he looks to me like he's a guy
that's always under control.
</p>

<p>
Uh, correction.
He's under control
most of the time.
</p>

<p>
And when people
like that let go,
stand back.
</p>

<p>
Oh. I'll tell you
why I'm interested.
He offered me a job.
</p>

<p>
Oh?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Well, welcome to the family.
Yeah, here's my problem.
</p>

<p>
I don't know
how much to ask for.
Whatever you can get.
</p>

<p>
Top man can pull down about 30,000.
</p>

<p>
No kidding? [Whistles]
That's a lot of money.
</p>

<p>
Gee, listen.
Does anybody else here
make more than that?
</p>

<p>
I mean,
besides Mr. Brimmer?
</p>

<p>
Well, maybe Leo.
</p>

<p>
Who's Leo?
Leo Gentry.
</p>

<p>
He's the boy who gets
the cream of the cases.
Hey, I think I know him.
</p>

<p>
Crew cut, ex-marine type?
</p>

<p>
Yeah, that's Leo.
</p>

<p>
Teacher's pet,
at least this month.
</p>

<p>
Hey, listen.
Where can I talk to him?
</p>

<p>
Maybe he can give me
a few pointers.
</p>

<p>
Oh. I haven't seen him
around yet today, but, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'll get his address
from Personnel.
</p>

<p>
Uh, don't mention it
to Brimmer.
</p>

<p>
Who me? No.
That's the last thing I'd do.
</p>

<p>
[Children Chattering]
</p>

<p>
Higher.
Higher? Listen.
If you go any higher,
</p>

<p>
you're gonna go
right over the top.
</p>

<p>
Hey, what's going on?
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Gentry? I wanna tell you,
you got a terrific kid here.
</p>

<p>
Nothing frightens him.
You can't scare this boy.
</p>

<p>
I said higher!
Higher?
</p>

<p>
All right, listen. You go higher,
and I'll eat your ice cream, all right?
</p>

<p>
No, I wanna eat it.
You wanna eat it.
</p>

<p>
All right. Here you go.
You're coming down.
</p>

<p>
Down to earth. There you are.
Get your ice cream.
</p>

<p>
Do we know each other?
Uh, no.
Uh, my name is Columbo.
</p>

<p>
I'm a lieutenant.
I'm from the police.
</p>

<p>
My daddy's a private eye.
&lt;i&gt;I know that, Teddy.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
And he's a very good one.
Listen. Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Well, is it about Leo's work?</li>
<li>Well, not exactly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm working on a case, and I thought
maybe he could help me out.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But I can't seem to locate him.</li>
<li>He went away.</li>
</ul>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;That's right, Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;His boss called last night&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
and sent him
on a special assignment.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I see.
Uh, do you know where he went?
</p>

<p>
Or, uh, how long
he's gonna be away?
</p>

<p>
Sorry. That's the way
it is with Leo.
</p>

<p>
He took his passport,
so I guess he's overseas
somewhere.
</p>

<p>
I see.
Is there
something wrong?
</p>

<p>
No, no, no. No, not really.
Listen. Maybe you could help me out.
</p>

<p>
Was Leo recently on a case
where he was following a woman?
A married woman?
</p>

<p>
Well, it's&#x2026; it's possible,
but I don't really know.
</p>

<p>
No? You never discuss Leo's work?
</p>

<p>
No. It's a household rule.
</p>

<p>
I mean,
I'm not very much
at keeping secrets.
</p>

<p>
If Leo were to tell me anything,
it'd be all over the Laundromat.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions,
you better ask Leo.
</p>

<p>
It's kinda hard to ask him,
because I can't locate him.
</p>

<p>
He went away.
</p>

<p>
But why don't you talk
to his boss, Mr. Brimmer?
</p>

<p>
He can tell you
what Leo's working on.
</p>

<p>
Uh, oh, yeah.
I, uh&#x2026; Thanks.
</p>

<p>
I have the feeling
he won't be too much help.
</p>

<p>
But, uh, at any rate,
uh, I'm sorry I bothered you.
</p>

<p>
Bye-bye, Teddy.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;F- E-L-O-P-&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Z-D.
</p>

<p>
All right. Now try
the next to the bottom line.
</p>

<p>
F-D-P-
</p>

<p>
T-C-E-O?
</p>

<p>
Perfect vision.
Well, it should be.
This is a new prescription.
</p>

<p>
Here's your temporary.
You should have your license
in a few weeks.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much.
Keep this too.
</p>

<p>
Next.
</p>

<p>
Now, while I mark your test,
please read from the eye chart,
third line down.
</p>

<p>
Did that lady say that
she just got a new pair of glasses?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What?</li>
<li>[Slams Counter]</li>

<li>She wasn't wearing glasses.</li>
<li>Of course she was.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Excuse me.
Uh, wait.
What about the eye chart?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And all of a sudden,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I remembered this picture.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;See? She's wearing glasses.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
But there were no glasses
on the body.
</p>

<p>
Now, could she have
dropped them somewhere?
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
but you're on the wrong track.
</p>

<p>
Why?
Well, shortly after
that picture was taken,
</p>

<p>
Lenore gave up
wearing glasses.
</p>

<p>
She switched
to contact lenses.
</p>

<p>
Ah, contact lenses.
</p>

<p>
Just a matter of vanity.
She thought she looked better.
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh.
Did she wear 'em often?
</p>

<p>
All the time.
She was extremely nearsighted.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kennicutt,
where's your wife's
personal effects?
</p>

<p>
The funeral director
sent them over.
</p>

<p>
I've avoided
going through them.
</p>

<p>
Do you mind?
No, go ahead.
</p>

<p>
This her lens case?
</p>

<p>
Yes.
</p>

<p>
It's empty.
</p>

<p>
Well, she was probably
wearing them when she died.
</p>

<p>
Well, then maybe, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Maybe what?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kennicutt,
I'm gonna ask your permission
for something.
</p>

<p>
This is the world's
biggest long shot.
</p>

<p>
And it's gonna be
painful for you.
</p>

<p>
But I think it's won'th a try.
</p>

<p>
Would it help?
There are no guarantees.
</p>

<p>
All right, Lieutenant.
You have a blank check.
</p>

<p>
Mobile Operator,
the number I want
is &lt;i&gt;476-7301.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Line Ringing]
They just arrived,
and they're entering the vault.
</p>

<p>
The medical examiner's
with them.
Why? What's the reason?
</p>

<p>
Haven't been able to find out, sir,
but I did learn one thing.
</p>

<p>
Kennicutt signed
an exhumation order.
</p>

<p>
All right, stay there.
I'll be right over.
</p>

<p>
Get my car ready.
</p>

<p>
He says it won't take long.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Car Ignition Grinding]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Ignition Continues Grinding]
</p>

<p>
What's the trouble?
I don't know, sir.
</p>

<p>
The battery's okay,
but the car won't start.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Ignition Grinding]&lt;/i&gt;
I'm in a hurry.
Get me another car.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Have this one serviced.
Tell them I want it tomorrow.
&lt;i&gt;Yes, sir.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Tires Squealing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Police Radio Chatter]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Police Radio Chatter Continues]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Arthur.
I should have phoned you,
but there wasn't time.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's all right.
One of my men told me
you were here.
</p>

<p>
Something break?
I don't know yet.
They're exhuming Lenore's body.
</p>

<p>
Tell me why.
</p>

<p>
Well, the lieutenant's
working on a long shot.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, she was wearing
her contact lenses when she was killed.
</p>

<p>
How's that significant?
</p>

<p>
Well, there's a chance that
she might have lost one of them&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
maybe both of them
at the scene of the crime.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, Arthur,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I don't like to be critical,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;but that's more&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;than a long shot.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You might as well buy
a lottery ticket.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Maybe not.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Listen to me.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
My nephew wears those things,
and half of the time they're falling out.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Now, the other morning at breakfast,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;one of them ended up in the cereal.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Brimmer] Mrs. Kennicutt&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;is not your nephew, Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Listen. Mrs. Kennicutt was struck forcibly.
Now let's bear that in mind.
</p>

<p>
Why isn't it possible
that they were knocked loose?
</p>

<p>
Anything's possible.
</p>

<p>
The autopsy report
said nothing about
any of this at all.
</p>

<p>
Listen. Forget about
the autopsy report. I checked with
the medical examiner about that.
</p>

<p>
They snuffed it off.
They didn't even bother to look.
</p>

<p>
All they were concerned about
was the cause of death.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, I hope it's not a waste.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
What else can I do?
</p>

<p>
I've got to pursue
every possibility.
</p>

<p>
Arthur, it's almost
a criminal breach&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
to disappoint you now
after what you've been through.
</p>

<p>
Move over.
</p>

<p>
Listen. We're in luck.
The right contact lens is missing,
and it's not in the coffin.
</p>

<p>
Well, it might have fallen out
in the morgue, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Or in the ambulance. Or in the street.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;She might have lost it&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;before she was killed.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Could be a hundred places.
&lt;i&gt;That's true, but maybe&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
and this is what
we gotta hope for&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
maybe it's at the place
where she was murdered.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Kennicutt]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But we don't know&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;where that place is.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Columbo]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No, sir, we don't.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;We don't know for sure.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
But I've got a few hunches.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Unless you can be specific,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I can't help.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I think the lieutenant
deserves some room.
Don't you?
</p>

<p>
As you wish.
You go your own way,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Thank you, sir. I will.
But keep us posted.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir. I will.
I'll keep you posted.
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
</p>

<p>
I only wish one thing.
</p>

<p>
I wish the murderer
knew about this.
Why?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;There'd be a piece of conclusive evidence&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that might be lying around in his premises,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;and he'd have to find it&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;before we did.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I'll keep you posted, sir.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Doorbell Rings]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, uh, Mr. Brimmer.
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Listen. I'm sorry
to bother you at this hour,
but, uh&#x2026; May I come in?
</p>

<p>
Yes, sure. Come on in.
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.
</p>

<p>
Okay. Fine,
if you can make it a little brief.
It's been a late day.
</p>

<p>
Oh, sure. Say, this is
some terrific place you got here.
</p>

<p>
And you got the sound
of the ocean all the time, huh?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Well, me, I love the beach.
I love it.
</p>

<p>
Except when the water gets cold,
then I don't like to go in.
Then I like a pool.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, did you say you
had something on your mind?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah.
It's about that job you offered me.
</p>

<p>
I've been giving it a lot of thought.
</p>

<p>
Uh, as a matter of fact,
uh, I haven't been able to sleep.
</p>

<p>
And, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Boy, this is a fantastic rug.
My wife would love this rug.
</p>

<p>
We gotta get a new rug,
and this is just the kind she wants.
</p>

<p>
Fantastic piling, huh?
</p>

<p>
Very soft.
</p>

<p>
Bet you could lose a shoe in here
for a week, you wouldn't find it.
It's late.
</p>

<p>
I still got a lot of work to do.
You were talking about my job offer.
</p>

<p>
I really don't think I'd be very happy
making a change, you know.
</p>

<p>
I like it where I am.
It's not a bad life.
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Uh, is that final?
</p>

<p>
I think so, yes.
No hard feelings?
</p>

<p>
No, no, certainly not.
I just, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Well, I think you're
making a mistake.
That's all.
</p>

<p>
You're probably right.
You know, my wife,
</p>

<p>
she's always said
I don't have enough ambition.
</p>

<p>
You know what it was
that really made up my mind?
</p>

<p>
What was that?
The Kennicutt case.
</p>

<p>
I don't wanna give up
working on it just now.
</p>

<p>
Not when I'm so close
to a solution.
</p>

<p>
Well, uh, are you gonna
let me in on it?
</p>

<p>
Oh, certainly.
Don't worry.
</p>

<p>
You'll be the first to know.
Good night.
</p>

<p>
Good night.

<li>Yes, this is Mr. Brimmer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You took my car in
to be repaired, didn't you?
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir. Just like you said.
They'll try to have it for you
as soon as they can.
</p>

<p>
All right then.
Good night.

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Car Door Opens, Closes]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You mind telling us
what you're doing?
</p>

<p>
I'd say that was none of
your business, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Well, if you say so,
but, uh, it's gonna be kinda
hard to explain, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
I mean, breaking and entering?
That's against the law.
</p>

<p>
Checking the trunk of your car.
What in the world
were you looking for?
</p>

<p>
Papers&#x2026; for a case.
</p>

<p>
I thought they were here.
It's an emergency.
</p>

<p>
Why don't you admit it?
You were searching the trunk,
'cause that's where you hid the body.
</p>

<p>
All right.
What's the next step?
</p>

<p>
Why don't we go downtown
and talk it over?
Am I under arrest?
</p>

<p>
I guess you could say so.
On what evidence?
</p>

<p>
I think it's gotta be
more comfortable downtown.
All right.
</p>

<p>
Let's get this farce
over with.
</p>

<p>
Grab his arm!
</p>

<p>
It was an accident, Arthur.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't&#x2026; premeditated.
</p>

<p>
I hardly knew your wife.
</p>

<p>
I didn't want to hurt
either one of you.
</p>

<p>
It happened.
</p>

<p>
How'd you get it?
</p>

<p>
I got it from
the cut on her cheek
and your ring.
</p>

<p>
You never should have
let me read your palm.
</p>

<p>
'Cause then I felt the ring
and I felt the two diamonds
sticking out&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and that raised
rectangular border.
</p>

<p>
That matched up
with the cut on her cheek.
</p>

<p>
You should have
taken that job.
</p>

<p>
You know,
we're lucky Lenore lost this.
</p>

<p>
Uh, she didn't lose it.
What?
</p>

<p>
When I spoke
to the medical examiner
at the cemetery,
</p>

<p>
he told me
that both contact lenses
were on the body.
</p>

<p>
But that's impossible.
If it isn't hers, whose was it?
</p>

<p>
Who knows?
Anyway, it doesn't make any difference.
</p>

<p>
The fact that it's not
the real contact lens,
that doesn't count.
</p>

<p>
What does count
is Mr. Brimmer's actions&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
coming here tonight,
trying to get rid of that thing&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and doing it all
in front of witnesses.
</p>

<p>
What would you have done
if the car hadrt broken down?
</p>

<p>
You couldn't set up
this trap.
</p>

<p>
Well, I guess we would have
found some other way.
</p>

<p>
You know what this place
reminds me of?
</p>

<p>
Just seeing all these cars&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You know, in our neighborhood,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;we had a bunch ofjokers.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I mean, we were
a real wild bunch of guys.
</p>

<p>
And we figured out a perfect way
to put a car out of commission.
</p>

<p>
You take a potato,
you stick it in the exhaust pipe.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It doesn't cause any damage,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;but the car won't start.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
It was a terrible thing to do.
And I got a feeling&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that the reason I became a cop
was to make up for all those jokes
I played when I was a kid.

I would have called, but&#x2026;
But what?

I didn't want to risk a wiretap.
</p>

<p>
A wiretap?
</p>

<p>
You sound paranoid, Colonel.
</p>

<p>
No, General.
Just being cautious.
</p>

<p>
And the reason
for this&#x2026; caution?
</p>

<p>
The word just came down
this morning.
</p>

<p>
A special directive
to all section chiefs.
</p>

<p>
The Inspector General's
starting a full-scale investigation
of arms contracts.
</p>

<p>
I see.
</p>

<p>
You're sure?
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
That's unfortunate.
</p>

<p>
But I suppose it would have
happened sooner or later.
</p>

<p>
If they find out&#x2026;
They won't find out.
</p>

<p>
General,
if anyone digs deep enough&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
they're bound to discover that
I've let your construction company
charge us a fortune in cost overruns.
</p>

<p>
You'll offer
the standard explanation&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
unforeseen difficulties
in developing the arms system.
</p>

<p>
It won't stand up, General.
When the I.G. Sees
your bargain-basement bids&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
he'll know I let you
practically steal those contracts.
</p>

<p>
They'll indict both of us.
</p>

<p>
As you say, Colonel,
you're the one that accepted the bids.
</p>

<p>
You approved the overruns.
</p>

<p>
With that much money involved,
they'll know we had to be in it together.
I'm getting out.
</p>

<p>
Oh?
</p>

<p>
I'm leaving for Geneva tonight.
</p>

<p>
And if I may make a suggestion,
General, you might do the same.
I have a business to run.
</p>

<p>
Besides, I never believed
in a forced retreat.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Well, maybe you can bluff them, sir,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;but I don't have your reputation.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You'll have less
of a reputation if you go AWOL.
It's an admission of guilt.
</p>

<p>
They won't know it for 30 days.
I just took my annual leave.
</p>

<p>
It's a small world, Colonel.
They'll find you.
</p>

<p>
No way, sir.
I'll manage to disappear.
</p>

<p>
And, uh, if they do,
just for the sake of argument?
</p>

<p>
Naturally, l-I'd keep your
involvement to myself.
I'd refuse to testify.
</p>

<p>
Not even to shorten a jail sentence
for giving evidence?
</p>

<p>
Believe me, sir,
there's nothing to worry about.
They won't know where I am.
</p>

<p>
How did you get here, Colonel?
Taxi?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No, sir. I drove. Why?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I've been thinking.
</p>

<p>
You present me with a problem.
</p>

<p>
Problem?
</p>

<p>
You assure me&#x2026; that my name
will never come into this&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that, uh, you'll be my protector.
</p>

<p>
I'm afraid I can't take that risk.

<p>
&lt;i&gt;There. See?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I don't see anything.&lt;/i&gt;

He just moved away from the window.
&lt;i&gt;You've been out&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in the sun too long.&lt;/i&gt;

Oh, it's a mirage.
</p>

<p>
No. No, we're going back.
</p>

<p>
We're going what?
Which way is back?
</p>

<p>
Which way is&#x2026;
What are you doing?
Ooh! Ooh!
</p>

<p>
I got it. It's all right.
I'm all right. I'm all right.
You take this.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, l-I got that.
Now&#x2026; Now, y-you take this.

<p>
But what'll I do with it?

it was a military uniform.

who sees things, Officer, not me.

looking in the other direction
doesn't mean that I didn't see it.
Come on.
</p>

<p>
Uh, where was this shooting,
Mrs. Stewart?
</p>

<p>
Right over there. See?
See that house over there?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Sanchez]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Are are you sure?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, yes. Oh, yes.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Do you know
who lives in that house?
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026; Well, no.
Does it matter?
</p>

<p>
I'd rather not say till we've
had a chance to investigate.
Oh, yeah.
</p>

<p>
May I have your address?
&lt;i&gt;She lives with me.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
8090 Vale.
</p>

<p>
May I have your phone?
&lt;i&gt;985-4321.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Okay. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Is that&#x2026; Is that all?
</p>

<p>
For now. If we need anything more,
you'll be contacted.
Oh.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
Uh, &lt;i&gt;985-4321.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yes, ma'am.
</p>

<p>
Come on. Come on!
You know, I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
On that shooting report, Sergeant,
the witness says it occurred
in General Hollister's house.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; General Hollister?
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
It just doesn't seem right
that a slick sleeve like me&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
would barge in
and ask a man like General Hollister
if he just shot somebody.
</p>

<p>
I see your point, Sanchez.
I'd better send over
somebody from Homicide.
</p>

<p>
Stand by,
and I'll have him there
as soon as I can.
</p>

<p>
Roger.
</p>

<p>
Sorry, sir.
Huh? For what?
</p>

<p>
This spot's reserved.
Oh. I see. All right.
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026; Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Who is it reserved for?
The police.
</p>

<p>
I think I'm the one
that you're waiting for.
</p>

<p>
I'm, uh, a lieutenant.
My name is Columbo.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Sorry, Lieutenant.
I was expecting an official car.
</p>

<p>
That's all right.
</p>

<p>
Your name is Sanchez?
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
I see.
That's General Hollister's house
right there.
</p>

<p>
Did anyone come in or out
since you've been here?
</p>

<p>
Two young fellows in cadet uniforms
went in a little while ago.
</p>

<p>
That's their wagon over there.
Uh-huh.
</p>

<p>
Is there another way
out of this house?
By water.
</p>

<p>
The general's got a yacht
in a slip in back of the house.
</p>

<p>
I see. I'm gonna go in
and speak to the general.
</p>

<p>
While I'm doing that,
I want you to search the yacht.
</p>

<p>
But, Lieutenant,
I don't have a warrant.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'll ask the general
for permission.
</p>

<p>
If he doesn't give it,
then I'll get a warrant.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;In the meantime, check it out.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Pay particular attention to the engines.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And if you find out anything,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;let me know.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Doorbell Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh, General Hollister?
Yes?
</p>

<p>
I'm from the police, sir.
My name is, uh, Columbo.
Lieutenant Columbo.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you,
sir, but we have this report,
uh, about this shooting.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A shooting?</li>
<li>Yes, sir. In this house.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That's quite an opening line,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Sir, I'm sure it's just
a crackpot complaint, but I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But it's your job to follow it up.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
I understand. I've had to do
many unpleasant things myself
in the line of duty.
</p>

<p>
But may I ask, this alleged shooting&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Just who is supposed
to have shot whom?
</p>

<p>
Well, you see, sir,
we don't know exactly.
</p>

<p>
Only that the, uh, victim
was wearing some kind of a uniform.
</p>

<p>
A uniform.
</p>

<p>
Well, come in.
</p>

<p>
These young men are from
my alma mater, Lieutenant, M.M.I.
</p>

<p>
They're here to take away
my military souvenirs for, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
permanent enshrinement
at the Memorial Hall.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant,
M.M.I. Is giving me
a testimonial dinner tonight.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Hammering]&lt;/i&gt;
They're commemorating
the 20th anniversary of my retirement&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and the opening
of the Hollister Exhibit.
</p>

<p>
Yes. General, do you think
I could, uh, look inside?
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
wouldn't that be a little obvious?
</p>

<p>
I wanna be in a position, sir,
where I can tell my superiors
that I've checked everything out.
</p>

<p>
They've already started
nailing it shut.
Uh, it's just two nails, sir.
</p>

<p>
Very well. Gentlemen,
I have a friend here who would like
to inspect the contents of the crate.
</p>

<p>
Would you open it again, please?
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Wow!
</p>

<p>
A lot of guns.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
War trophies, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Uh, AK-47 assault rifle.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;PPSH-41.&lt;/i&gt; Drum.
</p>

<p>
PPSH-41clip.
</p>

<p>
All Soviet-made, and,
as you've observed,
all with their firing pins removed.
</p>

<p>
I see. They're very,
very interesting, General.
[Clicks]
</p>

<p>
War mementos, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Lively memories, empty uniforms&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
uh, all carefully packed,
Lieutenant, for the exhibit.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Oh, yes, of course.
I'm sorry, sir. Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'll just put these back in here.
</p>

<p>
There you are. I, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I think that, uh, is fine.
Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
Carry on, gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
Could I offer you something?
Oh, no. Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
Say, you got a beautiful place here.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
It's roomy, and it's homey, and&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
That's a fireplace.
</p>

<p>
Wow!
</p>

<p>
You know, when I was a kid,
we used to have those
fake wooden kinds.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if you remember
them or not, General.
</p>

<p>
They had a fan in the back.
And it had a red light and ribbons.
</p>

<p>
You'd turn on the fan,
and the ribbons,
they would flutter there.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, they were terrific.
</p>

<p>
That's funny.
What's funny?
</p>

<p>
Don't you have those irons?
</p>

<p>
You know, like you put in a fireplace
to put the, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh. Uh, andirons.
Andirons. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
No. I never build a fire there.
It's too much trouble.
Oh.
</p>

<p>
Easier to turn up the thermostat.
I see.
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026;
Oh, uh, for show.
</p>

<p>
Oh, that's for show.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I've been thinking.
</p>

<p>
The person who turned in
that report was right.
</p>

<p>
There was someone here
in uniform.
</p>

<p>
Me.
</p>

<p>
While I was packing&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I couldn't resist, uh,
trying on the old harness, you know.
</p>

<p>
I'm glad to be able to tell you
that, uh, I can still get into it.
</p>

<p>
You know, the report said
there was another man here,
and he was dressed in a bathrobe.
</p>

<p>
Whoever filed that report
was seeing double.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I was wearing a bathrobe
while I was packing.
</p>

<p>
Got a match?
A match.
</p>

<p>
There you are.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Hey, that's quite a lighter.
&lt;i&gt;One of a kind.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yeah, that's something.
[Coughs]
</p>

<p>
Didn't you say that you
were gonna send all of your stuff
over to the exhibit?
</p>

<p>
Not quite everything, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
This has a very
personal meaning for me.
</p>

<p>
It's a gift from my staff
on the day that I retired from service.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
General, uh,
do you mind if I look around?
</p>

<p>
No. By all means,
help yourself.
</p>

<p>
Not much to see here.
</p>

<p>
Just a basic B.O.Q.
</p>

<p>
I guess that's why I like it.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Any servants?&lt;/i&gt;
Just a housekeeper.
Comes in twice a week.
</p>

<p>
Good night, General.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Let me get the door.
</p>

<p>
Careful.
</p>

<p>
Good night.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
the bedrooms are this way.
</p>

<p>
Guest bedroom, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Master bedroom.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;General, have you&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;been here all day?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
No. I was out on my boat
till about 2:00.
</p>

<p>
You didn't go out after that, sir?
No.
</p>

<p>
I was here packing, getting ready
for the testimonial dinner.
</p>

<p>
Do you mind if I look in your closet?
No.
</p>

<p>
By all means,
be thorough, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Extra uniforms.
</p>

<p>
General,
that's a lot of fruit salad.
</p>

<p>
Past history&#x2026; all to be donated,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Well, you've had the tour.
Anything else I can do for you?
</p>

<p>
No, I guess that's it.
</p>

<p>
Unless&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Unless what?
</p>

<p>
Well, as long as I'm here, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
do you happen
to own a gun, General?
</p>

<p>
A handgun?
A hand&#x2026; Oh. No, I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Yes. Yes, I do.
</p>

<p>
A target pistol.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
It's a funny thing.
I never think of it as a weapon.
</p>

<p>
.22 caliber Hi-Standard.
</p>

<p>
Supermatic Trophy model.
There you are. Hmm?
</p>

<p>
What's that medal for?
</p>

<p>
Oh,
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
That's a first with
the United States Marine Pistol Team.
</p>

<p>
You know, Lieutenant, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I had this out earlier today.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking of giving
it over to the exhibition&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
although it's never had anything to do
with my military career.
</p>

<p>
I was, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I&#x2026; Oh, yes!
</p>

<p>
Yes, I remember now.
</p>

<p>
I stumbled over the crate
as I was looking at the gun.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That must've been what your witness saw.</li>
<li>Of course.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oh, well, there we are, huh?
</p>

<p>
There we are.
</p>

<p>
Oh.
[Laughs]
</p>

<p>
I doubt if I could&#x2026;
if I could win any medals today.
</p>

<p>
I've been so busy for months,
I haven't had any chance to practice.
</p>

<p>
[Sniffs]
Here, see for yourself.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm not
a ballistics expert, sir.
</p>

<p>
Well, take it along with you.
Have your people check it out.
</p>

<p>
No, I don't think
that'll be necessary, sir.
</p>

<p>
I think I'm on a wild-goose chase.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Matter of fact, uh,
I don't think there's much else
I can, uh, look for, General.
</p>

<p>
Uh, I think
I'll be running along.
</p>

<p>
Before you go, Lieutenant, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
just who, uh&#x2026;
who reported &lt;i&gt;this&#x2026; murder?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
No, I never said
it was a murder, sir.
</p>

<p>
Well, this alleged shooting.
Who turned in the report?
</p>

<p>
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that, sir.
Oh.
</p>

<p>
No, sir.
That's against regulations.
Oh, yes, of course.
</p>

<p>
Well, there's one thing for sure&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that whoever it was,
it had to be some&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
some guy out here
in a boat in the marina.
</p>

<p>
General, I'd like to keep
the record straight on that.
</p>

<p>
Now, I never said
that it was a man.
</p>

<p>
Oh, you mean it was a woman?
Now, I never said that either, sir.
</p>

<p>
Well, it doesn't make any difference.
</p>

<p>
Mistakes have no gender.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's for sure.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026; Well, I want to apologize
for takir up your time.
</p>

<p>
Please, don't give it a thought.
</p>

<p>
Good night, sir.
Good night, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Oh, uh, one thing I almost forgot.
&lt;i&gt;Yes?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh, your boat.
What about it?
</p>

<p>
I had the boat checked out,
sir, while we were talking.
</p>

<p>
I didn't think you had anything
to hide, sir, and I just thought
it would save some time.
</p>

<p>
I always preached initiative to my men,
so I don't see how I can object now.
</p>

<p>
And you're right.
You did save time.
</p>

<p>
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Good night.
Good night.
</p>

<p>
Oh, General,
enjoy your dinner.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Well, thank you, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Door Closes]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Police Radio Chatter]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Didn't find a thing.
The engines?
</p>

<p>
They were cold.
</p>

<p>
This Mrs. Stewart,
did she look like she'd could have
been doing any drinking?
</p>

<p>
Could've been.
I don't really know.
</p>

<p>
I guess we both got a lot
of paperwork to do, huh?
</p>

<p>
[Engine Starts]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Here, Joey.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Gas up number two, will you?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mr. Barnes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hi, General.
Hi. How are you?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Barnes, a couple of hours ago,
out on the marina,
somebody waved at me.
</p>

<p>
I think it was an old friend.
You got any idea who it could have been?
</p>

<p>
Was it one of my boats?
</p>

<p>
I think it might have been, yeah.
You might have it there in the record.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It was probably Mrs. Stewart</li>
</ul>
<p>
and her mother.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mrs. Stewart. That's it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Do you know where she lives?
I'd like to have a few words with her.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, sure. I got it right here.
Good.
</p>

<p>
Hey, General, you're not gonna
go sailing with her, are you?
Why?
</p>

<p>
She's the worst&#x2026;
man, woman or child.
</p>

<p>
She can't sail.
I couldn't take my eyes off her.
Really?
</p>

<p>
I thought that she was gonna
keel over any minute.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'll watch it, Mr. Barnes.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for your good thought.
Here you go.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
d &lt;i&gt;[Rock]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

[Laughing Continues]
</p>

<p>
d &lt;i&gt;[Soft Jazz]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Knocking On Door]&lt;/i&gt;
Just a minute.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stewart?
Yes.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Columbo, from the police,
about a report you made of a shooting.
</p>

<p>
Oh! Yes. Come in.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Mother]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Who is it, Helen?&lt;/i&gt;
It's the police, Mother.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Helen]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Um, we'rejust having a, uh,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;before-dinner cocktail.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Would you, um, uh&#x2026;
No, that's all right.
</p>

<p>
Ask for his identification.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mother, uh&#x2026;
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
That's all right. That's all right.
She's entitled to that.
</p>

<p>
You must be Mrs&#x2026;
Walters. Right.
Mrs. Walters. Walters.
</p>

<p>
Here you are, ma'am.
</p>

<p>
You sure don't look
like a policeman.
</p>

<p>
I have to make a salad.
</p>

<p>
Here you are.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Mother is the eternal optimist.
</p>

<p>
She's always hoping for the worst.
[Laughs]
</p>

<p>
Well, Lieutenant, uh, what, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
What is that?
Do you mind?
</p>

<p>
Would you like to see it?
I'd like it very much.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's&#x2026; it's not finished yet.
</p>

<p>
When it's done,
it's gonna be a bowl.
</p>

<p>
You know,
like for plants and things. Um&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Or maybe it's gonna be
an Indian water pitcher.
</p>

<p>
I haven't really made up my mind yet,
creatively speaking.
</p>

<p>
Well, this work is very,
very interesting.
</p>

<p>
Well, they say it's important
to work with your hands.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It's very good therapy&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
and she needs it.
</p>

<p>
I'm just a mass of
therapeutic studies lately&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
sailing, art classes.
</p>

<p>
I even went back to work.
What do you do?
</p>

<p>
I work with children
and animals.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's&#x2026;
that's constructive.
</p>

<p>
You see that?
That's a reflection of my job.
</p>

<p>
Oh. You don't know
what it is, do you?
</p>

<p>
Uh, no, I don't know what it is,
but it's very nice.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's a South American llama.
We have them at the Ark Park.
</p>

<p>
At the where?
</p>

<p>
The Ark Park.
That's where I work with
the children and the animals.
</p>

<p>
I see. So this fella here
is a llama, huh?
</p>

<p>
Well, you see, I try and go
beyond the surface, you know&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
to find, um, a deeper meaning,
a-a truer reality.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
At least, that's what I think I do.
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stewart,
I'm gonna get right to the point.
</p>

<p>
You know, I couldn't find
any evidence of any shooting
in that house that you pointed out.
</p>

<p>
I mean, there was no gun.
There was no victim.
There was nothing.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Just a house,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a fella livirin it.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, I know what I saw.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Maybe you think you saw it.</li>
<li>What does that mean?</li>
</ul>

<p>
The fella that owns that house
is a retired marine general.
</p>

<p>
He says that if you
saw him in the window&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
one, he was alone,
and two, he was wearing a bathrobe.
</p>

<p>
What about the man in uniform?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;He says that later on,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;he did try on an old uniform&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
and he was carrying
a target pistol at the time.
</p>

<p>
He says he happened to trip over
a crate that he was packing.
</p>

<p>
Now, to you, does, uh&#x2026;
does that sound like
a reasonable explanation?
</p>

<p>
Oh, very reasonable,
but it's not what I saw.
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh. I see.
</p>

<p>
Uh, did you ever wear glasses?
</p>

<p>
No, I don't wear glasses.
I have perfect vision.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No, I have better than perfect vision.</li>
<li>Mm-hmm.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Look, uh, I don't want you
to get offended at what
I'm gonna say now, but, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
were you doir
a little drinkir this afternoon?
</p>

<p>
Oh!
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Oh, Lieutenant,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;this is really too much!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I mean,
that police officer this afternoon,
and then my mother, and now&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I am not hallucinating!
I'm just trying to reconcile
your story.
</p>

<p>
I saw two men&#x2026;
one in a bathrobe,
and the other one in a uniform.
</p>

<p>
The one in the bathrobe
shot the other man.
</p>

<p>
That is the simple truth&#x2026;
the sane and the sober
and the simple truth.
</p>

<p>
Now, do you believe me?
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stewart, a murder charge
is about as serious as you can get.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant, I didn't ask you&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;if it was a serious charge.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I asked you if you believe me.
</p>

<p>
You always did have a weird imagination,
even as a child.
</p>

<p>
Those imaginary playmates,
all those games.
</p>

<p>
You never wanted to face reality.
</p>

<p>
Mother, to some people&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that would have meant that I had
a creative and imaginative mind.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Knocking On Door]&lt;/i&gt;
I'll get it.
</p>

<p>
Can't a person sit down
and have a bite to eat in peace?
</p>

<p>
Yes?
[Chuckles]
Mrs. Stewart?
</p>

<p>
No, no, no, no.
I'll&#x2026; I'll call her for you.
</p>

<p>
Helen darling,
there's a gentleman here to see you.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Helen]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For me?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Yes. Yes.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yes?
&lt;i&gt;You're&lt;/i&gt; Mrs. Stewart?
</p>

<p>
[Stammers]
You seem surprised.
</p>

<p>
Well, uh, pleasantly, I assure you.
</p>

<p>
What can I do for you?
</p>

<p>
You can watch the 11:00 news
on television tonight.
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
Apparently I need
a character reference.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
L-I'm afraid I don't understand.
</p>

<p>
You don't recognize me?
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
No. Should I?
</p>

<p>
You said that you saw &lt;i&gt;me&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
shoot somebody today.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No, no. You have nothing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to fear from me, Mrs. Stewart.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
But if you'll watch
the late news tonight&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'm sure you'll agree that, uh,
you've miscast me&#x2026; as a murderer.
</p>

<p>
Earlier this evening,
General Martin J. Hollister
was honored by his alma mater&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
the Marine Military Institute.
</p>

<p>
At the banquet tonight, M.M.I.
Dedicated the Hollister Exhibit&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
in their Memorial Hall.
</p>

<p>
The General thereby joining
other select alumni&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;who have distinguished themselves&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in the defense of their country.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;General Hollister was given&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a standing ovation.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;If any man in recent memory&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;may be said to have had charisma&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
certainly that man
was General Martin J. Hollister.
</p>

<p>
Early on in the Korean War,
as a colonel commanding
a regiment of armored cavalry&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Hollister captured the imagination
of the American people.
</p>

<p>
His courage, his brilliance in improvising
in the heat of battle&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
his colorful garb&#x2026;
riding breeches, boots
and pearl-handled Colt.45&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
soon earned him the nickname
'The Iron Horseman."
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Later as a brigadier general&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with his own division&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
he distinguished himself
by a daring end-run in which&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
out of ammunition
and using only his famous pistol
and a monumental bluff&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;he succeeded in capturing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the opposing enemy commander&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and his entire headquarters.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Finally, a land mine accomplished
what nothing else could&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
put General Hollister out of action
with severe wounds&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
wounds that necessitated
his untimely retirement
from active duty&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
as one of the youngest major generals
in this natiors military history.
</p>

<p>
On the foreign scene,
the Secretary of State again reiterated&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
the United States's determination
to keep current troop levels
in Europe stable.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;In reply to sharp Senate&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[TVOff&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You still think a man like that could
shoot someone for no reason at all?
</p>

<p>
He's practically on Mount Rushmore.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You didn't even recognize him&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;when he came here.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I was in a state of shock.
I mean, I didn't expect him
to show up on our doorstep.
</p>

<p>
Why don't you just admit
that you're not sure?
</p>

<p>
Because I am sure.
</p>

<p>
You were sure when you
were married to Tom too. Remember?
</p>

<p>
You had him running around
with every woman in town.
</p>

<p>
No wonder
he asked for a divorce.
</p>

<p>
Those were not mirages, Mother!
</p>

<p>
Those were flesh-and-blood ladies
he was carrying on with.
</p>

<p>
He even admitted it.
</p>

<p>
Your pot's overcooking.
</p>

<p>
That is not a pot!
</p>

<p>
It's a crock!
</p>

<p>
Oh!
[Clicks Tongue]
</p>

<p>
General Hollister.
Colorful character.
</p>

<p>
Reminds me of General Patton.
Old Blood and Guts.
</p>

<p>
How about a game of pool
before we call it a night, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
No, thanks, Bert. Not tonight.
I gotta get up early.
</p>

<p>
Got somethir special goir on?
</p>

<p>
Uh, yeah.
I think I'm gonna do a little fishir.
</p>

<p>
Hey. All right.
</p>

<p>
If you catch something good,
bring it in.
</p>

<p>
I'll give you a bowl of chili free.
Hey!
</p>

<p>
Come on, General,
just one more drink, huh?
One more?
</p>

<p>
Look, it's
4:00 in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Go on home
to your wives, gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
Let's go up
for one more drink.
</p>

<p>
Look, I always make it a rule
to be in bed before reveille.
</p>

<p>
Go home.
Good night, gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
</p>

<p>
[Clicks]
</p>

<p>
[Engine Running]
</p>

<p>
[Engine Revving]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Engine Slowing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Ahoy, Lieutenant.
You're an early bird.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Oh, yes, sir.&lt;/i&gt;
Be right with you.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Yeah.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I'm just, uh&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
combining a little
business with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
At this hour?
Well, George&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
My brother-in-law George?
Well, you don't know him.
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
But at any rate, he's
a fantastic fisherman, this man&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and he told me that
the best time to catch anything
is around about now.
</p>

<p>
He says, get there &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt;
everybody, and you kind of
catch the fish off guard.
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm.
Doesn't look like it worked.
</p>

<p>
Not yet.
But I'm gonna keep trying.
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm. I don't think
you'll catch anything big
around here, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
You're too close in.
</p>

<p>
Oh? Yeah, you know?
You're probably right.
</p>

<p>
General, there's somethir
I don't understand.
</p>

<p>
All the other fishing boats,
they were goir out&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and your boat is
just comir in.
Mm-hmm.
</p>

<p>
Why is that?
</p>

<p>
I've won a lot of battles, Lieutenant,
and I've caught a lot of fish&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
by doing the unconventional thing.
</p>

<p>
Do you know that
I have always envied
somebody with that talent?
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm.
I don't think
you can learn that.
</p>

<p>
You know, I think
you're born with that?
</p>

<p>
You know, inventors,
and military strategists?
</p>

<p>
Now, I wish I had that, because
that'd be a terrific thing in my work.
Do you know what I mean?
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm.
Yes, I'm sure it would.
</p>

<p>
Oh, General, talking about work,
there's a couple of loose ends
I'd like to tie up&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Nothir important, you understand,
but I would like to get 'em tied up.
</p>

<p>
Fire away.
Well, I was watchir the news
on television last night.
</p>

<p>
Those film clips of you in action?
Great stuff! Really.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thank you.</li>
<li>Yeah, it was just thrilling.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But you know, General, I happened
to notice that you were carrying
a pearl-handled pistol.
</p>

<p>
Splendid weapon.
A single-action Colt.45.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I remembered that!
That was kinda like your
trademark, wasn't it?
</p>

<p>
Well, the thing is this,
that, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
yesterday, when I asked you
whether you owned any guns&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
you showed me your souvenirs,
and you showed me your target pistol.
</p>

<p>
Which is all very well and good.
</p>

<p>
But I was wondering,
whatever happened to
that pearl-handled revolver?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Because when I looked&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;into the crate, you know&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I didn't see it in there.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Lost it, Lieutenant.
Long time ago.
</p>

<p>
When I was in the hospital in Korea,
someone ' liberated" it, you know.
</p>

<p>
Wanted a souvenir.
</p>

<p>
Actually, I was&#x2026;
I was pretty pleased it was taken.
</p>

<p>
It was getting to be just too much
of a publicity gimmick.
</p>

<p>
I see. So the Hollister Exhibit&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
is gonna have to do without
the famous Hollister gun.
</p>

<p>
Uh, not exactly. M.M.I.
Wanted one for their Memorial&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
so they had a duplicate made.
I see.
</p>

<p>
Uh-huh. Now, uh,
I've gotta change.
</p>

<p>
So, if there's anything else
I can do for you?
</p>

<p>
No, that'd be all, sir.
Oh, fine, fine.
</p>

<p>
Just a piece of advice.
</p>

<p>
Find a different spot.
Or use a different bait.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, you're not
gonna catch anything,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Goats Bleating]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Children Chattering]
</p>

<p>
[Animals Calling,
Bleating, Singing]
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stewart.
Mrs. Stewart?
</p>

<p>
Good afternoon. Did you watch
television last night?
</p>

<p>
Yes, I did.
Uh, how did you find me?
</p>

<p>
I went by your apartment.
Had a nice talk with your mother.
</p>

<p>
Quite a lady.
Isn't she?
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm. I understand
that you're through here
in about an hour.
</p>

<p>
Do you suppose that
you and I could go somewhere&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
oh, a public place, if you're worried&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
someplace where
we could have a drink?
</p>

<p>
Why?
Well, you're breaking the law.
</p>

<p>
Uh, wha? I don't
think I understand.
You're accusing&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
convicting and sentencing me,
without a fair trial.
</p>

<p>
Now, wouldn't you say
that that's un-American?
</p>

<p>
dd [LoungeJazz]
</p>

<p>
Here's to your convictions&#x2026;
and my acquittal.
</p>

<p>
Well, I don't judge you, General.
</p>

<p>
I just report what I saw.
</p>

<p>
Uh, I'd like to suggest&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
the possibility that
you were deceived.
</p>

<p>
Deceived by whom?
</p>

<p>
By yourself.
</p>

<p>
We all know the tricks that
the sun and the sea&#x2026; -
</p>

<p>
even your own eyes
can play on you, huh?
</p>

<p>
Particularly after
a long day on the water.
</p>

<p>
Would you admit
that that's possible?
</p>

<p>
Just possible.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
Well, I suppose so.
</p>

<p>
The defense rests. For today.
</p>

<p>
Now, I think we ought to
prosecute these martinis&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
before their statutes
of limitations expire.
</p>

<p>
Uh, your mother told me
that you were divorced.
</p>

<p>
Yes.
</p>

<p>
Well, I saw how very, um&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
good you were with those children?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do you have any of your own?</li>
<li>No.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unfortunately.
I always wanted them, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Tom&#x2026; why, th-that's my ex&#x2026;
he didn't want children.
</p>

<p>
We used to fight about that a lot.
[Laughs]
</p>

<p>
Well, maybe you only lost
one battle&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stewart.
</p>

<p>
Not a whole war.
</p>

<p>
Well, what about you?
Are you married?
</p>

<p>
No. Never could find the time.
</p>

<p>
First, there was my military career.
</p>

<p>
And then, my construction company.
I was married to the business, as they say.
</p>

<p>
Well, l-I can understand that.
</p>

<p>
Do you ever&#x2026; regret it?
</p>

<p>
Not really.
</p>

<p>
Oh, there are exceptions.
Like, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
last night, when the door opened
and I saw you.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
Oh, come on, General.
</p>

<p>
You don't think I'm so insensitive as to
not see through that remark, do you?
</p>

<p>
Now, what do you mean by that?
</p>

<p>
Well, yesterday I called the police&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and l-I reported that
I saw you shoot a man.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And today, you're telling me that when&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you saw me, music filled your ears&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
and thunder and lightning
filled the sky?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Oh, boy!</li>
<li>[Laughing] Yeah, you're right, you're right.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I guess if we both see such a scene
in a movie, we'd-we'd break up.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
I meant it, though.
</p>

<p>
And to prove that,
I want to take you to dinner.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Agreed?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I'll take that for a yes.
</p>

<p>
And if Helen had just closed her eyes
to some ofTom's&#x2026; flirtations&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
they might still be married!
</p>

<p>
Whatever happened
to your husband, Mrs. Walters?
</p>

<p>
Who knows! Sent him out
for Chinese food thirty years &lt;i&gt;ago&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
and I haven't
heard from him since.
</p>

<p>
You know that I have
raised that girl since she was
three years old, single-handed?
</p>

<p>
Mother&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stewart.
Hello, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Well, I hope you don't
expect to eat now.
</p>

<p>
No.
I already had dinner.
</p>

<p>
At a lovely restaurant
overlooking the city.
It was just beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Well, you might have called.
</p>

<p>
Did you dine alone?
</p>

<p>
Why, no. Not this time.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, I had
dinner with General Hollister.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;General Hollister!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, what do you know about that?
Are you gonna see him again?
</p>

<p>
Well, he-he asked me
to come out on his yacht.
[Giggles]
</p>

<p>
Well, that calls for a drink.
</p>

<p>
You play your cards right&#x2026;
bourbon today, champagne tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
Makes you kinda
wonder, doesn't it?
About the General.
</p>

<p>
What do you mean?
I didn't tell him your name, you know.
And I didn't tell him where you lived.
</p>

<p>
So, uh, he musta gone
to a lot of trouble to find you.
</p>

<p>
Curiosity about his accuser.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, could be that.
Course, it could be something else.
</p>

<p>
Oh, thanks a lot, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Am I so uninteresting that he couldn't
be interested in me for myself?
</p>

<p>
Oh, no. No, no.
No, I didn't mean that at all.
</p>

<p>
You're a very individual person.
</p>

<p>
No, what I was talking about
was the shooting. You see, I had
second thoughts about the shooting.
</p>

<p>
You see, our traffic people, they
picked up a couple of kids.
</p>

<p>
They were joyriding in a car
they hot-wired.
</p>

<p>
And it turned out this car belonged
to a Roger Dutton&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and he's a Marine colonel,
Mrs. Stewart.
</p>

<p>
And it could be that
he was the man that you saw
in the General's house.
</p>

<p>
You know, you did a lot of
investigating&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
for a man who asked me if I wore
glasses, or if I had been drinking.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's just
part of the job. Anyway&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I found out this Colonel Dutton&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
booked a passage on an 8:00 p.m.
Flight to Switzerland.
</p>

<p>
But then, he never showed up
to take the plane.
</p>

<p>
Well, l-I still don't
get the connection.
</p>

<p>
No, you see, this Colonel Dutton&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
he was in the Marine
Matériel Command&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
[Scoffs]
That's a, uh, he's
a procurement officer.
</p>

<p>
But he had a lotta dealings
with General Hollister.
</p>

<p>
And he suddenly took a leave
and then he just disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Now, if you could identify
the officer in this photograph&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
as the man that
General Hollister shot&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Then, I think, a lot of
these pieces would fall into place.
</p>

<p>
L-I can't be sure.
</p>

<p>
Well, now that photograph
is three years old&#x2026;
It all happened so quick.
</p>

<p>
I just can't be sure.
</p>

<p>
I see. Uh-huh. Okay.
</p>

<p>
We haven't found a body yet,
so why don't you just keep that?
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026;
And maybe we'll come
back to you, yes? All right.
</p>

<p>
Uh, good night, Mrs. Walters.
Good night, Mrs. Stewart.
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
You know what strikes me?
You're the one that downgrades yourself.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;One dinner&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with General Hollister&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
and you begin
to doubt your senses.

Helen? You awake?
</p>

<p>
Ahh! I never knew
how hard fishing could be.
</p>

<p>
Never tell that to a fisherman.
Look.

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And in the window?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Chuckles]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I can't see anything,
because of the reflection
of the sun on the water.
</p>

<p>
You know, you said that
you saw a shooting there,
about this same time of day.

What?
No, I&#x2026;
I'm kind of a klutz.
</p>

<p>
Well, you know, my ex-husband,
Tom, you know, he was&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
he was like a ballroom dancer,
I mean, he was so smooth&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
it was like&#x2026; it was like
he was ice skating, you know?
</p>

<p>
And then, I mean, I&#x2026;

</p>

<p>
Well, people used to smirk
and make jokes. [Chuckles]
</p>

<p>
Those were my plumper days.

I looked like a radish.

Come here.
No!

[Male Announcer]
This late development has just
come into our newsroom.
</p>

<p>
Early this morning, the body
of a man surfaced in the ocean
one-half mile off Marago Cove.
</p>

<p>
The body has been identified
as that of Colonel Roger Dutton&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;of the United States&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Marine Matériel Command.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;The police report that Colonel&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Duttors whereabouts has been&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in question for the past two weeks.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;We return you now to&lt;/i&gt;
The TimothyJones Show.
</p>

<p>
[Clicks Off]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Ahoy!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Ahoy, there, Lieutenant.
What's this, another
fishing expedition?
</p>

<p>
Not exactly. Just wanted
to talk to you, General.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm afraid I can't
right now. No time.
</p>

<p>
Uh, unless you want to go along.
A short scenic cruise?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I,&lt;/i&gt; uh&#x2026; &lt;i&gt;I'm taking an overnight haul.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I want to test the engines.&lt;/i&gt;
Okay.
</p>

<p>
Uh, cast this line off down here
and then hop aboard, huh?
</p>

<p>
[Engine Revving]
</p>

<p>
[Columbo] Gorgeous craft!
Must have cost a mint, huh?
</p>

<p>
As they say, Lieutenant,
if you have to ask, you can't afford it.
</p>

<p>
Right. You know, the biggest thing
I've ever been on before is a rowboat.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
you didn't come all the way
out here just to talk about
life on the high seas.
</p>

<p>
Huh? Oh!
</p>

<p>
No. No, I was wondering, General&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
have you heard about that body
that they found off Marago Cove?
</p>

<p>
Oh, Colonel Dutton?
Yeah, I just heard about it.
Just came on the radio.
</p>

<p>
That is shocking.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Any idea what happened?</li>
<li>Yes, sir.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Somebody shot him, sir.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I guess they weighted him down&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and then theyjust dumped him.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Is that a fact?
&lt;i&gt;Yeah.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I guess the sharks must
have cut through whatever
was holding him down.
</p>

<p>
Well, this is all very
interesting, Lieutenant, but
why are you telling me this?
</p>

<p>
Well, sir, uh&#x2026;
to protect you.
</p>

<p>
Protect me?
&lt;i&gt;Yes, sir.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You see, I know
that this is ridiculous&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
but the fellas down there
at the department, they're sayir&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
they've got some kind of
a pretty good case against you.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Oh? [Chuckles]</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>

<li>Of course, they're way out</li>
</ul>
<p>
of line, I know that.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Of course, of course.</li>
</ul>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;But you know, they have these ideas,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and it could be embarrassing.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I tell ya, I, uh&#x2026;
I kinda hate to get into it.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I mean, a man of your stature&#x2026;</li>
<li>By all means, get into it, Lieutenant.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Columbo] Well, take motive.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Your construction company got a lot
of contracts through Colonel Dutton.
</p>

<p>
So did hundreds of other companies.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, but it seems as though
he was being investigated
by the Inspector General.
</p>

<p>
And if he were killed, there
would be no way of proving&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
a conspiracy
to defraud the government.
</p>

<p>
Well, if no one's around, perhaps
that means it doesn't exist!
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Engine Rewing]&lt;/i&gt;
Right.
</p>

<p>
Right, that's a good point.
</p>

<p>
Uh, there's one other thing.
</p>

<p>
Uh, the morning
after he disappeared&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
you went out on your yacht.
</p>

<p>
Sheer coincidence.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, it probably is.
But we do know that the body
was disposed of at sea.
</p>

<p>
Now, I've been studying
the tides, General.
</p>

<p>
Now, the Coast and Geodetic
Survey's got a book on 'em&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and it shows that a body dumped
off the marina in the ocean&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
might carry down
to Marago Cove.
</p>

<p>
Might, Lieutenant. Might.
</p>

<p>
Sheer speculation!
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, you should tell
your&#x2026; colleagues&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that they have yet to show any link
between Colonel Dutton and myself&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
something that would prove
that we actually met on that day.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir, uh, you're right there.
</p>

<p>
But now that you mention it,
it occurs to me that the night
that the colonel disappeared&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I did see a car like his
across the street from your house.
</p>

<p>
I don't know what kind
of a car the colonel drove&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
but there must be thousands
of them in Southern California.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You didn't, uh, by any chance&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
[Sighing Deeply]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Check the registration at the time?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh, no, sir. No, sir, I didn't.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's no reason to.</li>
<li>Now, that was unfortunate, wasn't it?</li>
</ul>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Revs Engine]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Uh, General, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go back now.
</p>

<p>
Yes, as you wish. I guess we're
about through with this test run.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Rewing Faster]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You know, Lieutenant,
I don't see how a man&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
with the name of' Columbo"&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Shouldn't he be
more at home on a boat?
</p>

<p>
Must have been another branch
of the family, sir.
</p>

<p>
How soon before we land?
</p>

<p>
Not long.
</p>

<p>
[Groans]
</p>

<p>
You know, General, there is a link
between you and Colonel Dutton.
</p>

<p>
Really?
Mrs. Stewart.
</p>

<p>
An eyewitness to the murder
of a military man in your house.
</p>

<p>
Help the lady aboard.
</p>

<p>
Oh! Oh, Lieutenant, would you&#x2026;
[Fussing]
Let me take the bag.
</p>

<p>
Well, no, maybe you better&#x2026;
Could you just&#x2026; Yeah. No, no. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Should I take the bag? All right.
Yeah, yeah. [Grunts]
All right?
</p>

<p>
There we are.
Okay? Oh!
Thank you. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Are you all right?
Me? Fine.
</p>

<p>
Just fine, yes. There's something
I wanted to talk to you about,
Mrs. Stewart.
</p>

<p>
Uh, we've just recovered a body.
</p>

<p>
A Colonel Dutton, the man
that I spoke to you about?
</p>

<p>
Somebody dumped him
in the ocean.
</p>

<p>
He thinks I shot him.
What I think is unimportant.
</p>

<p>
What counts is what you saw.
</p>

<p>
[Scoffs] I&#x2026;
Well, l-I didn't see anything.
</p>

<p>
Well, now, Mrs. Stewart,
that's not what you said.
</p>

<p>
Well, no, it was the light,
some crazy reflection&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Yeah, but you told me
that you distinctly&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I don't care what I said.
I was wrong.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can't a person make a mistake?</li>
<li>Look, maybe if I could talk</li>
</ul>
<p>
about this later on.
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna say the same thing later
that I'm saying now, so would ya&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Would you just
please leave me alone?
</p>

<p>
If you ever want to go out again,
I'll be happy to take you, Columbo.
</p>

<p>
[Sighs Deeply]
</p>

<p>
Hey, Lieutenant. How goes it?
</p>

<p>
So-so, huh?
</p>

<p>
How 'bout a bowl of chili?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bert, gimme some chili.</li>
<li>Ah, there you go.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Comir right up, Lieutenant.
&lt;i&gt;[Bowl Rattles]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Got the best in town,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you know.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You got a match?
&lt;i&gt;Sure!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Lemme get this chili to ya.
</p>

<p>
Here you go, your crackers&#x2026;
&lt;i&gt;[Silverware Rattling]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Blows]
</p>

<p>
Here you go.
Help yourself.
</p>

<p>
How do you like that coffee?
Is that black?
What's this?
</p>

<p>
What is this?
That's my helmet from the war.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What war?</li>
<li>What war. World War II!</li>
</ul>

<p>
My wife says I can never
throw anything out.
</p>

<p>
So the other day she put
her foot down. She says
either the junk goes or she goes.
</p>

<p>
You decided to keep her.
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
It was a tough decision.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I brought all
my war trophies over here.
</p>

<p>
Hey! Wait a minute.
</p>

<p>
You're one guy that can
appreciate this. I'll get you
another bowl of chili.
</p>

<p>
My chili is good, no matter what&#x2026;
Here. Yeah, I got this, that&#x2026;
Look at this.
</p>

<p>
Like, I saved a little&#x2026;
It's a Japanese stirring spoon.
</p>

<p>
I got 'em at Okinawa,
the commissary. Yeah.
[Chuckles] Ah, well.
</p>

<p>
You know, I guess my wife is right.
I can't give anything away.
</p>

<p>
Especially when it means
something to ya.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Yeah, that was&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a long time ago, Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
Yeah.
Bert, gimme a dime.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Okay, Lieutenant.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;There you go.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Let me give you that&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;bowl of chili I dropped on ya.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Is that cream and sugar&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in that coffee?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stewart? Lieutenant Columbo.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stewart?
Listen.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate very much
your coming down here
and meeting me.
</p>

<p>
Just remember our agreement,
Lieutenant. No questions and no
trying to get me to change my mind.
</p>

<p>
Not one question.
Not even a half a question.
</p>

<p>
I only wanted you
to see the exhibit.
</p>

<p>
Why?
Look.
</p>

<p>
In order to understand a man,
you have to understand his past.
</p>

<p>
Quite a collection, huh?
</p>

<p>
You see that book?
That's a &lt;i&gt;Marine Military Manual.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Do you know the story
behind that book?
No. Mm-mm.
</p>

<p>
Martin wanted to wait till the first
rush of tourists had passed, so he
could explain everything to me himself.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Gee, I guess he wants you
to know what kind of man he is too.
</p>

<p>
About this book.
There's a bullet in that book.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;A sniper tried to kill him.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And that book stopped a bullet.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And you know, he never batted an eye?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I mean, that&#x2026; that tells you something
about what kind of man he is.
</p>

<p>
Yes, that he's a man
filled with courage.
</p>

<p>
More than a great deal.
I think he has an unusual
amount of courage.
</p>

<p>
More than you and I,
and more than average people.
</p>

<p>
I mean, if was me,
I would faint.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I mean, most people would&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;take time to recover.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;But he didn't.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You see, I think he's, uh&#x2026;
He's a very a cool man under pressure.
</p>

<p>
Hey, that's nice, isn't it? Isn't that
beautifully cut? Custom tailored.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You know, I think&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;it's almost too nice.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I mean, all that concern about clothes,
it's kinda vain, don't you think?
</p>

<p>
[Clicks Tongue]
Some men, Lieutenant&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
do not want to look like
an unmade bed.
</p>

<p>
Just look at this stuff.
[Clicks Tongue]
</p>

<p>
Look at that!
</p>

<p>
I mean, this man just had
a natural flair for attracting
attention to himself.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes undesirable
attention, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
You don't seem
surprised to see me.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I was kind of expecting you.
I mean, when I spoke to Mrs. Stewart&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I had a hunch that she'd tell you.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I'd like to know what this is all about.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
All right, sir.
I'll get right to the point.
</p>

<p>
It's has to do with
that duplicate of your gun.
</p>

<p>
What about it?
</p>

<p>
Well, I find it hard to believe&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stewart, see if you
agree with me on this&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
lfind it hard to believe
that a man like General Hollister&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
who saved and cherished
every war souvenir&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
even the smallest photograph&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I just think it's strange
that he was so careless as
to allow his gun to be stolen.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I mean, that pistol was the most famous&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;single symbol ofhis whole legend.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You agree with me, don't you?
</p>

<p>
Well&#x2026; [Sighs]
</p>

<p>
I don't know what
you want me to say.
</p>

<p>
Well, if it was me&#x2026;
if it was my gun&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I would take very good care
of that gun.
</p>

<p>
I'd have it in my apartment
where people could see it&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and I would keep it polished,
and I would keep it oiled&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and I would keep it loaded.
</p>

<p>
And when a certain Colonel Dutton
came to see me&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and threatened to expose me,
</p>

<p>
that's the gun that I would use.
</p>

<p>
Well, if what you say is true,
I mean, you searched!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Where &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; that gun?</li>
<li>That's what I asked myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Where is the gun?
</p>

<p>
Why not on public display?
Why not in a glass case?
</p>

<p>
Why not in front of
thousands of people?
</p>

<p>
And after we found Colonel
Duttors body, anybody else&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;you, me, anybody else&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
We'd have gotten rid of that gun.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;We found the bullet in the victim&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;and the ballistics check will&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;match up the bullet with the gun.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
But somehow, General,
something told me&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that you could never
get rid of that gun.
</p>

<p>
It meant too much to you.
</p>

<p>
You couldn't even
part with a cigarette lighter.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No, that pearl-handled pistol&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;was just too tied up in your pride.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Because of your tremendous
belief in yourself, you figured
everyone would accept your story&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
about having a duplicate made.
</p>

<p>
But there never was a duplicate made,
was there?
</p>

<p>
This, in fact, is the murder weapon,
isn't it, General?
</p>

<p>
I assume Ballistics has
checked out the gun.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;That won't be necessary.&lt;/i&gt;
All right, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
[Softly]
I'm sorry.
</p>

<p>
What is it with me, Lieutenant, huh?
</p>

<p>
I seem to have a special talent, you know?
I mean, with&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
With all the men in the world,
</p>

<p>
I always seem to pick Mr. Wrong.
</p>

<p>
I'm seriously considering locking myself
in a closet for the rest of my life.
</p>

<p>
No. That's wrong.
</p>

<p>
That's just the way my niece,
Marilyn, felt after her divorce.
</p>

<p>
Now she's got a new husband.
As a matter of fact, he's a cop.
</p>

<p>
And they got six kids.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant&#x2026; I mean, just between us,
would you tell me the truth?
</p>

<p>
Do you really have a niece?
What kind of a question is that?
'Do I really have a niece?"
</p>

<p>
Well, do you?
Of course I've got a niece!
My wife's sister's girl, Cynthia.

</p>

<p>
You're late.
I'm sorry.
The path out there was dark.
</p>

<p>
Anybody see you?
No. And I parked
where you told me.
</p>

<p>
Good. Take that.
</p>

<p>
[Gasps]
</p>

<p>
Pull yourself together.
There's no reason to be frightened.
</p>

<p>
It's just my uncle.
</p>

<p>
And I assure you,
he's far more amiable now
than he ever was when he was alive.
</p>

<p>
I'll be all right.
Of course you will,
my love.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't possibly be
any help to your career
from inside a gas chamber.
</p>

<p>
Don't say things like that.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, what difference
does my career make?
</p>

<p>
Dale, look,
they're all yours now.
</p>

<p>
They will be,
but not unless you do your part.
</p>

<p>
Don't worry, Dale.
L&#x2026; I was just a little upset.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm fine.
Good.
</p>

<p>
Now remember,
when you open the window, fire high.
</p>

<p>
You better get started.
That electric blanket
goes back upstairs&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Top drawer, left side.
How many times have you
told me that? Dale, hurry!
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Door Opens, Closes]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Chattering]
</p>

<p>
All right, Melvin,
5,000 and it's a steal.
</p>

<p>
Would you please move faster?
Uh, boys, keep those bottles popping.
</p>

<p>
Thank you. Good evening.
</p>

<p>
One thousand dollars?
And you're not even a Frenchman.
&lt;i&gt;[Woman] Mingle, mingle.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, you see, the only thing
I really need is something pink
for the guest bathroom.
</p>

<p>
I just paint the pictures, ma'am,
I don't set prices.
</p>

<p>
Don't pick on my artist, darling.
After all, your husband
adores cactus. He told me so.
</p>

<p>
I know, but it's the wrong shade
of pink for the wallpaper.
</p>

<p>
Well, how about 800?
I mean, that's if he takes
the green Indian to go in the office.
</p>

<p>
Mind you&#x2026;
I'm so glad you&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh, excuse me.
</p>

<p>
Dale! Dale Kingston,
I don't believe it.
</p>

<p>
Your invitation said free champagne,
Mitilda, my love.
</p>

<p>
Oh, you're such a snob.
You never come to my showings.
Sam, quick!
</p>

<p>
Well, I had nothing to do
tonight anyway. I was
half hoping that it'd be over by&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh, it's just begun.
Please, Dale. Excuse me.
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026; [Clears Throat]
Sam&#x2026; This is Sam Franklin.
</p>

<p>
It's his first private showing,
so would you please be nice?
Honey, this is Dale Kingston.
</p>

<p>
How do you do?
Yes, yes.
How do you do, sir?
</p>

<p>
Oh, you must be the artist of these,
uh, arid little landscapes, aren't you?
</p>

<p>
Well, they're not too bad.
Not too bad at all.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kingston?
&lt;i&gt;Mr.&lt;/i&gt; DaleKingston?
Yes.
</p>

<p>
Yes.
And you're
the famous art critic?
</p>

<p>
Well, as of the moment, yes,
whatever the moment happens to be&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Of course he is, darling,
and you're already
raving about Sam's work.
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry, dear.
But you couldn't possibly have
this cactus for a penny less than 12.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have five minutes to 11:00, sir.</li>
<li>Five to 11:00.</li>

<li>Yes.</li>
<li>So it is.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thank you very much, Mr., uh, Franklin.
</p>

<p>
Oh, of course
you'd love champagne.
Oh, you bet.
</p>

<p>
Sam, the painting.
</p>

<p>
And so that the meaning of the mobile
stems not only from its form,
</p>

<p>
but the relationship between the pieces,
which gives it its meaning.
</p>

<p>
And I suppose the relationship
between the pieces
is really where it's at, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
[All Laughing]
</p>

<p>
Yes.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Gunshot]&lt;/i&gt;
[Tires Screech]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Keys Jangling]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
It's not so much a question of
his masculinity. I think the artist
just saw him that way.
</p>

<p>
[All Laughing]
I'll drink to that.
</p>

<p>
You notice no matter
how abstract the painter,
</p>

<p>
he always signs his name
realistically, doesn't he?
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
Of course.
</p>

<p>
[Engine Starts]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Police Chatter]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Were you home tonight?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, no, sir.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
My wife and I
left the house at 8:00.
It's our regular night off.
</p>

<p>
There's just you and your wife?
No other servants in a place this size?
</p>

<p>
Well, Mr. Mathews
seldom entertained.
</p>

<p>
He was divorced many years ago
and has very few friends.
</p>

<p>
Tonight I believe he planned
to spend in his room reading.
Just a minute.
</p>

<p>
You got all this, Columbo?
You want anything more
from Mr. Evans?
</p>

<p>
No.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Please, sir!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mathews was very fussy
about smoking.
</p>

<p>
Oh, sorry.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Doctor,
call us from downtown, will ya?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I don't think the autopsy
will change my opinion.
</p>

<p>
It was a single bullet.
Must've died almost instantly.
</p>

<p>
And the time of death?
Oh, I'd say around 11:00,
give or take a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
Wasn't it?
Yeah. The body was still warm.
</p>

<p>
Talk to you later, Captain.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mr. Kingston.
I've been trying to reach you.
I'm so terribly sorry.
</p>

<p>
Somebody broke in, I assume?
Yes, your uncle
probably came down&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I told him about it.
He just got back to
his apartment at 2:00,
</p>

<p>
His gun is missing from his desk.
After some party
at a gallery, he says.
</p>

<p>
There are two paintings missing,
I think. I told them
to hold everything for you.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kingston, we've been waiting
to dust some of these canvases
for fingerprints.
</p>

<p>
Evans wouldn't let us
touch anything but the frames.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's perfectly all right.
No problem as long as you're careful.
Which ones did you want?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man] These right here.&lt;/i&gt;
I suppose he's gonna be
your new boss, huh?
</p>

<p>
Well, I would hope he keeps on
and keeps the house.
</p>

<p>
After all, he's Mr. Mathews's
only living relative.
</p>

<p>
But, really, sir,
at a time like this&#x2026;
Oh, listen. I'm sorry.
</p>

<p>
Of course. You're absolutely right.
</p>

<p>
Would you like to spend some time with
your wife? I'm sure she's very upset.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Mr. Kingston,
before you get too involved there&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Excuse me a minute, Captain.
Okay.
</p>

<p>
I wonder if maybe first you'd try to
help me out with a problem I have?
</p>

<p>
Yes.
Um, it's this&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
this painting.
Well, what's the problem?
</p>

<p>
Haven't you ever seen people
without faces before?
</p>

<p>
They've loaned them out.
</p>

<p>
You've heard of two-faced people,
I suppose?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes.
But, uh,
</p>

<p>
you see, it's this
crazy signature that bothers me&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
DeGrote. George DeGrote.
Quite famous.
</p>

<p>
I thought so.
Isn't that funny?
</p>

<p>
'Cause I noticed the signatures
on this other painting, um&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Does that say Birnbaum?
Yes, it does.
</p>

<p>
That's what I thought.
'Birnbaum."
</p>

<p>
You'd think that these artists
would be able to write more clearly.
</p>

<p>
Really, do you think all this is
quite appropriate at this time, Mr&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh, I guess not.
Uh, I realize this has been
a terrible shock for you.
</p>

<p>
I wanna express my deepest sympathies.
Thank you, Mr&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Columbo.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Uh, tell me, Mr. Kingston,
has anybody tried to
rob this place before?
</p>

<p>
Certainly. This place is
a magnet for art thieves.
</p>

<p>
It's one of the finest collections
in the world.
Is that so?
</p>

<p>
Yes.
Really? Very impressive.
</p>

<p>
You seem inordinately fascinated
by these paintings.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'll tell you what bothers me.
You see, it's this.
</p>

<p>
If you came in here
to grab some paintings,
wouldn't you grab a DeGrote first&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
instead of a Birnbaum?
Perhaps.
But then, I'm an art critic.
</p>

<p>
You're the detective.
You're the art critic.
That's right.
</p>

<p>
And I'm gonna need
a lot of your help.
I suppose you noticed that already.
</p>

<p>
Uh, like in there,
there's two little frames
and they're empty,
</p>

<p>
and there doesn't seem to be
anything around that fits inside.
</p>

<p>
Oh, no.
</p>

<p>
Now, Mr. Evans
wasn't quite sure either.
</p>

<p>
He thought that one of'em
had some dancing girls.
</p>

<p>
But I don't think
he knows much about art either.
</p>

<p>
He also said that
a lot of these things
had just been rehung.
</p>

<p>
That they'd just come back from
some kind of a traveling exhibit?
</p>

<p>
Yes, that's what those crates are
out in the hall there. I unpacked
most of them myself.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. You know, I noticed that
a piece of that wrapping paper
had been torn loose.
</p>

<p>
These two are listed
in the exhibit catalogue.
</p>

<p>
Got that in here somewhere.
</p>

<p>
[Clears Throat]
Here, look.
</p>

<p>
Those were the two
that were taken?
Yes.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hey, they're beautiful.</li>
<li>&lt;i&gt;They're two of my favorites.&lt;/i&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Degas pastels.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Pastels? You mean like
the kids use in school?
</p>

<p>
Nobody ever used pastels
like Degas, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
These two alone together
happen to be won'th
over a half million dollars.
</p>

<p>
[Whistles]
</p>

<p>
You know, that's funny too.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Not at all. There isn't a painting&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in this entire exhibit&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that's won'th under 50,000.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
No, I mean that out there,
somebody picked a Birnbaum first.
</p>

<p>
Then when your uncle interfered,
then when he went to his desk
and took out a gun,
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;then when he was killed&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in the middle of all that, then&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
the thief suddenly got smart,
</p>

<p>
and he took two of
the most valuable paintings
in the house and he ran.
</p>

<p>
Guess that does seem
a bit inconsistent, doesn't it?
</p>

<p>
Then life has
its own inconsistencies.
</p>

<p>
Lt. Columbo?
Oh, Sally,
nice of you to come.
</p>

<p>
Let's go out back.
I wanna try something.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Mr. Kingston,
you might be interested in this.
</p>

<p>
Uh, you were here?
Yeah, that's right.
</p>

<p>
Wait there.
I'll holler.
All right.
</p>

<p>
Hi.
Hi. Hi, Charlie.
How are you?
</p>

<p>
What's all this?
</p>

<p>
Well, you see,
they have private patrolmen here
to make checks at every hour.
</p>

<p>
At 11:00&#x2026;
No, no, no.
I mean this, this, this.
</p>

<p>
What? Oh, the lock?
Yes.
</p>

<p>
Well, you see, he found that open.
The lock was scarred like
it'd been forced from the outside.
</p>

<p>
Of course, what I don't understand
is why the burglar alarm didn't go off.
</p>

<p>
A professional thief could
manage that pretty well, couldn't he?
No, no, no.
</p>

<p>
You see, professionals,
they always pick windows.
</p>

<p>
They're just easier to crack.
Sally, are you ready?
Whenever you are.
</p>

<p>
Okay. When I holler inside,
you run just the way
I told you to run.
</p>

<p>
Okay! Here she goes!
</p>

<p>
Well?
&lt;i&gt;[Guard] That's it.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That's what I heard.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I couldn't be sure before.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I was running myself.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Now you heard high heels
on those stone steps?
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much.
You bet.
</p>

<p>
Charlie, will you get Sally?
Wait a minute.
</p>

<p>
You mean, you think
the thief was a woman?
One of'em.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One of them?</li>
<li>Well, there were too many pictures for</li>
</ul>
<p>
one person to carry, don't you think?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And besides, the burglar alarm thing.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You know, there's only one way&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to really beat that&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
is if you have somebody else
from the inside open the door.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I don't think I understand.</li>
<li>You know what?</li>
</ul>
<p>
That's the trouble. Neither do I.
</p>

<p>
Well, if you ever want to know
any more about art, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Thank you very much.
Well, listen, now that you mention it,
tell me this.
</p>

<p>
How does a thief get rid of
a painting like that?
</p>

<p>
I mean, if they're that famous,
how can anybody sell it?
</p>

<p>
Well, someone in
a foreign country maybe.
</p>

<p>
Although, art thieves usually try to
make a deal of some kind with the owner,
the gallery, the insurance company.
</p>

<p>
You see, that's what I thought.
It's just like a kidnapping.
</p>

<p>
Yes.
In other words, what they want really
is the ransom.
</p>

<p>
Exactly.
Right.
</p>

<p>
So, you know in this case,
somebody must be pretty scared
right now, don't you think?
</p>

<p>
Might be anxious to settle quick.
</p>

<p>
Possibly.
Sure.
</p>

<p>
You know, and since
you're the first person
they might try to contact&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you what.
You give me your telephone number&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and I'll put a tap on your phone
and we'll monitor all your calls.
</p>

<p>
You wouldn't mind that, would you?
</p>

<p>
Of course not.
Why should I?
</p>

<p>
Gee, thank you very much.
Good night.
</p>

<p>
Good night.
</p>

<p>
[Line Ringing]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Phone Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Continues Ringing]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Bell Rings]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Groans]
</p>

<p>
Look out!
Gee, I'm sorry.
</p>

<p>
[Laughs]
Oh, that's all right. I've been
bumping into things myself today.
</p>

<p>
A little bit too much of
the grape last night. I didn't
clear out of here till 3:00 a.m.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kingston went home
a little earlier than that, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Well, he stayed long enough
to make every other gallery owner
on the street &lt;i&gt;green&lt;/i&gt; with envy.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you know,
Dale is usually in London or Paris.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;He doesn't fool around&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;with us peasants.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you what
I really wanna know&#x2026;
what time he got here.
</p>

<p>
Yes. I know, I know.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Sam is right through there.
I called the parking boy.
Be over in a minute.
</p>

<p>
Sam, this is the policeman
who phoned.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Is it all right?&lt;/i&gt;
Uh, bring him in.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;They interrupted Rembrandt,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;why shouldn't they interrupt me?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yeah, what is it?
</p>

<p>
If I'm interrupting something&#x2026;
No, you're not
interrupting anything.
</p>

<p>
Uh, forgive the mood,
but, uh, you caught me
in a bad day.
</p>

<p>
This here is Chris.
Oh, hi.
</p>

<p>
Hello.
Are you an artist?
No.
</p>

<p>
I can come back another time.
I think I'm&#x2026;
Go ahead and interrupt.
</p>

<p>
I'm here under duress.
Thanks a lot.
</p>

<p>
Stop moving!
I'm trying to paint you.
Well, paint.
</p>

<p>
Well, actually, it's very routine.
It's not that important. I think&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Well, me and champagne
are not routine.
</p>

<p>
And if you're interested in
finding out about Mr. Kingston,
what time he got here I don't know.
</p>

<p>
Uh, there was something about
his watch, but I'm not sure.
</p>

<p>
Might help if
you try to remember.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah. Well&#x2026;
[Exhales]
</p>

<p>
Uh, there was something wrong
with his watch.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, that's it, and, uh,
and he asked me what time it was.
</p>

<p>
That's it.
That's it. I see.
</p>

<p>
Well, thanks.
Sorry to bother you.
No bother.
</p>

<p>
Right.
I'm in my commercial phase
right now.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Sam's just mad at
the whole world that's all.
</p>

<p>
That's because I made him
put her in his pretty pink cactus.
</p>

<p>
Can you imagine? He thinks
the artist should decide what the&#x2026;
&lt;i&gt;Mitilda, are you looking for me?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Mumbles]
Fine.
</p>

<p>
Well, listen, I'll let you
finish your work. Excuse me.
</p>

<p>
Do come back soon.
&lt;i&gt;[Sam]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Stop moving!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
All right.
</p>

<p>
Hey, Joe,
didn't the other boys tell me
you parked Kingstors car last night?
</p>

<p>
Sure, I remember.
The guy who gave me two bucks.
</p>

<p>
Two bucks?
Just for parking a car?
</p>

<p>
No. He lost a cuff link.
I helped him search
the whole car for it,
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;trunk and everything.&lt;/i&gt;
Did you find it?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No. Why?&lt;/i&gt;
Well, you know, most people's trunks,
they're kind of messy to look into.
</p>

<p>
His wasn't. Nothing but a spare tire
and a topcoat. Nothing else
in the whole car.
</p>

<p>
What time was that?
Would you know?
</p>

<p>
Oh, sure, 'cause he asked me.
Something was wrong with
his watch, I guess.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It was five minutes to 11:00, sir.</li>
<li>Mmm. Thanks. All right, that's it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, uh, what is
this all about?
</p>

<p>
Because, like, uh,
Dale's uncle was murdered
sometime last night, right?
</p>

<p>
Oh, no. Oh, no&#x2026;
[Laughs]
</p>

<p>
When I think what this
is gonna do to the art world.
</p>

<p>
Can you imagine an art critic ineriting
that gorgeous collection? I do.
</p>

<p>
Hey. Hey, would you look at that.
</p>

<p>
A blue horse?
</p>

<p>
Painting the ladies and gentlemen
of the Spanish court with a savage brush.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Relentlessly, unremittingly&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;showing them in every detail,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;down to the tiniest wart.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
But, when you take the ' W"
off of wart,
</p>

<p>
you are still left with ' art,"
and Goya was the penultimate artist.
</p>

<p>
We will continue our discussion
of this fascinating artist tomorrow.

Good afternoon.

[Rings]
</p>

<p>
Studio 2. Yeah, we just broke.
I'll call him.
</p>

<p>
[Over P.A.]
Telephone call, Mr. Kingston.
Thank you, Phil.
</p>

<p>
Phil, listen. While I've got you,
can we manage to get&#x2026; Is that on?
</p>

<p>
Phil, can't you cut that camera off me
the minute I finish talking, please?
</p>

<p>
I'm always left
with egg on my face.
Thank you.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>Dale, I finally got you.</li>

<li>I remembered you'd be</li>
</ul>
<p>
doing your show.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What are you doing calling?</li>

<li>I told you not to call</li>
</ul>
<p>
for a whole week.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I know, but I was worried.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That's just free-floating anxiety, dear.
Now, relax. Everything's going just&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'm terribly sorry.
No, I simply don't have time.
</p>

<p>
Well, Lieutenant.
Gee, I wish you wouldn't hang up
like that, Mr. Kingston.
</p>

<p>
I mean, somebody you don't know
tries to call&#x2026;
Lieutenant,
</p>

<p>
I get a dozen calls a day
just like that from would-be artists,
</p>

<p>
from ladies who want to evaluate some
stupid, little print their maiden aunts
left them in their attic.
</p>

<p>
If I paid attention to
every one of'em&#x2026;
You mean, that was a woman?
</p>

<p>
Yes, and it wasn't any ransom call
if that's what you're thinking.
</p>

<p>
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a museum to go to,
then a dinner, then a lecture.
</p>

<p>
Well, I was hoping that
we could have a little time to talk.
We can get together later if you'd like.
</p>

<p>
[Loud Exhale]
No, I've gotta
take my makeup off anyway.
</p>

<p>
May as well do it now.
Follow me.
Fine. Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
Uh, so this is
a television studio, huh?
Yes.
</p>

<p>
Quite a place.
Well, it's a barn, really.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure it's not as glamorous
as you'd thought it'd be.
That's right. It isn't.
</p>

<p>
But things aren't really
what they seem to be, are they?
</p>

<p>
My, how observant you are.
</p>

<p>
Hildy, my beauty,
how fast do you think
we can get this paint off me?
</p>

<p>
I'll use high-speed turpentine.
</p>

<p>
Well, anyway, uh,
I'm sorry to bother you here,
but you haven't been home much.
</p>

<p>
Now that's too bad in a way.
That tap on your phone,
it's not helping us any.
</p>

<p>
I'm not
your only possibility, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
I don't know whether
you know this,
but my uncle was married once.
</p>

<p>
In fact, his ex-wife still lists
herself in the phone book
under her married name.
</p>

<p>
So, you see, whoever took
those paintings could very well be
trying to contact her.
</p>

<p>
You know, somebody mentioned that.
So I saw Mrs. Mathews this morning.
We're watching her phone too.
</p>

<p>
[Chuckling]
Oh, that must have been
some interview.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Edna can be
a bit trying.
I thought she was kind of nice.
</p>

<p>
Oh, she's very nice,
but, uh, trying.
</p>

<p>
Well, you said you had
some questions you wanted to ask me?
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Nothing important,
just a few details.
</p>

<p>
Like that backdoor thing.
That really bothers me.
What about it?
</p>

<p>
Um, does that coffee machine work?
Yes, of course it does.
What about it?
</p>

<p>
Well, you know, the lab says that
there was just no way for that lock
to be forced from the outside.
</p>

<p>
Thank you, Hildy. So?
</p>

<p>
Would you like a coffee?
No, thanks.
</p>

<p>
Well, how did anyone get in?
</p>

<p>
You see, Evans is positive that
all the doors were locked
when he left the house earlier.
</p>

<p>
And I don't see your uncle
letting anyone in, unless he knew 'em.
</p>

<p>
Did you come all this way
just to tell &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; that?
</p>

<p>
Well, I thought you'd be interested.
Like, I did clear up one routine thing.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You know that gallery&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;you went to? Checked out.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hope you don't mind.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, that's your job. And?
</p>

<p>
The parking lot boy, he remembered
when you got there all right.
</p>

<p>
So that if Mr. Mathews
was killed at 11:00,
then you sure didn't do it.
</p>

<p>
Now isn't that a shame, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
And here I am your best
and most obvious suspect too.
[Tsking]
</p>

<p>
Aw, don't say things like that.
Really, you've got me all wrong.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah.
&lt;i&gt;It's just that I get bugged by&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;those little things.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Like, no connection.
</p>

<p>
But why would a person look in
the trunk of a car
for a missing cuff link?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Brush Clatters On Vanity]&lt;/i&gt;
'Cause I happened to toss
my topcoat in there&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
in order to
keep it from getting stolen.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Then I noticed that the link</li>
</ul>
<p>
was missing.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Of course.</li>
</ul>

<p>
See, I could've guessed that.
</p>

<p>
A little while later I found the link
caught in the lining of my sleeve.
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna tell you somethir.
</p>

<p>
Do you know that there is
a reasonable explanation for everything
if you just put your mind to it?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Of course, sometimes these things,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;they pop up.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Like with alibis.
Do you know in most cases,
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;people, they don't remember&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;what time it is.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;They forget all that.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Like the artist fella.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
He's all mixed up about the time.
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Mathews,
she don't even remember
what time she went to bed last night.
</p>

<p>
Well, being sober
might help, I suppose.
</p>

<p>
Now, with you, Mr. Kingston,
it's just the opposite. Very unusual.
</p>

<p>
With you, we know exactly
where you were and when.
</p>

<p>
Not only that,
we know your whole car was empty.
</p>

<p>
Yes. Isn't that nice?
</p>

<p>
Well, if you'll excuse me.
Mm. Oh, listen, by the way,
can I show you something?
</p>

<p>
It's only gonna take a second.
Uh, you can rent paintings,
did you know that?
</p>

<p>
Yes, I know.
And my father-in-law,
he loves Western movies,
</p>

<p>
so I figured, a few bucks,
you can't get hurt.
</p>

<p>
Uh, what do you think?
</p>

<p>
Any good?
&lt;i&gt;For wallpaper in a child's room,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;absolutely perfect.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
In fact, it looks like
it might've been done
by an untalented 12-year-old.
</p>

<p>
You know, I was kind of
afraid you were going to
say something like that.
</p>

<p>
[Clicks Tongue]
But you know, then I say,
</p>

<p>
why would you bother to
go there last night
if this guy's stuff is so bad?
</p>

<p>
I mean, this was painted by the artist
whose exhibit you were covering.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Columbo,
unlike my uncle, I am not
independently wealthy.
</p>

<p>
I have to work for a living.
Magazines pay me to review art.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, they pay me best
when I write hostile reviews
about hacks like Sam Franklin.
</p>

<p>
Oh. Well, I'll tell ya,
I'd sure hate to see
his review when you write it.
</p>

<p>
Mmm.
Oh, listen.
One more thing.
</p>

<p>
It just&#x2026; It'll just take a second.
I stopped by your apartment a few times.
</p>

<p>
Why, do you want to
search my place?
</p>

<p>
No. Just to ask you something
about art.
</p>

<p>
You said you had some books
and things there that I could see.
</p>

<p>
You may look at anything you wish.
</p>

<p>
You can snoop in all of my closets.
You can peek under the beds.
</p>

<p>
You won't find any stolen paintings.
Oh, really, I've never said
anything about&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Here. Would you like the key
to my apartment? You may simply
leave it under the mat when you leave.
</p>

<p>
No, really. L&#x2026;
No, no. Go ahead.
I insist.
</p>

<p>
See what I live like.
Find out what kind of
human being I am.
</p>

<p>
Learn everything you can
about me.
</p>

<p>
Well, I&#x2026; I mean, I admit
it would be more convenient.
</p>

<p>
But, uh, thank you
very much, Mr. Kingston.
</p>

<p>
Uh, I'm sorry I took up
so much of your time.
</p>

<p>
I might drop by
and borrow a few books
or something like that.
</p>

<p>
See ya.
</p>

<p>
Dale!
</p>

<p>
You all right?
Yeah. I'm sorry
I called you.
</p>

<p>
Well, I just couldn't wait.
I had to know what was happening.
</p>

<p>
Nothing's happening.
No problems at all.
Everything's just perfect.
</p>

<p>
Now, the gun and the paintings,
</p>

<p>
they're still in your car, right?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah.
I did exactly what you told me.
I haven't touched a thing.
</p>

<p>
Good. You'll feel a lot better
once you get those off your hands.
</p>

<p>
Hold that open for me.
</p>

<p>
Dale!
&lt;i&gt;What's the matter?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well-Well, I never saw them before.
They're beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Now why can't I
paint like that?
</p>

<p>
Patience, my dear.
Patience.
</p>

<p>
I told you you had talent
when you first came to see me, remember?
</p>

<p>
Takes time to get
what you really want.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I think my talent
isn't what you like best about me.
</p>

<p>
Well, it's a combination
of things, Myla.
</p>

<p>
Dale, you do
care for me, don't you?
</p>

<p>
After the risks
you've taken for me?
</p>

<p>
Of course I do.
</p>

<p>
Now let's get out of here.
Is there anything else
you want me to do?
</p>

<p>
Not a thing.
I'll be in touch with you by phone.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When will I see you again?</li>
<li>Very shortly, my love.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When will I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
[Tires Squealing]
</p>

<p>
Columbo.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mr. Kingston.</li>
<li>What are you doing here</li>
</ul>
<p>
at this hour of the night?
</p>

<p>
Is it night?
</p>

<p>
Yes, it is.
</p>

<p>
Gee, I&#x2026;
I must've fallen asleep here.
</p>

<p>
I came in to read these book&#x2026;
Did you get your key?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I left a key under the mat.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, good. You got it.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Gee. Yes, I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I was readir these articles.
I must've fallen&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm terribly sorry.
I just fell asleep here.
</p>

<p>
Look, it's quite late, Lieutenant.
If you don't mind,
</p>

<p>
I've just had a tiresome evening
at a lecture,
</p>

<p>
after which I spent some time
with some even more tiresome people
from the museum.
</p>

<p>
So if you'll excuse me.
Oh, of course.
</p>

<p>
I'll get out of your hair.
I'm-I'm awfully sorry about this.
</p>

<p>
Did you pick up something interesting?
</p>

<p>
Uh, no, just some, um,
insipid watercolors that
these people want me to evaluate.
</p>

<p>
Watercolors?
Yes.
</p>

<p>
I was just looking at watercolors.
Matisse? Wonderful.
</p>

<p>
I'd love to hear
what you had to say about him.
</p>

<p>
Could we take just a moment&#x2026;
No&#x2026; Lieutenant, please!
</p>

<p>
If you don't mind, I&#x2026;
Oh.
</p>

<p>
It's quite late.
I'm-I'm quite exhausted.
Some other time, please.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm sorry. Of course.
I should've realized.
&lt;i&gt;[Telephone Ringing]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I just got so caught up
in this art thing&#x2026;
My phone. My phone, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Your phone?
My phone.
</p>

<p>
Oh.
It, uh, just might be
people about the ransom.
</p>

<p>
Oh. By all means.
</p>

<p>
Hello? Yes.
</p>

<p>
Yes, he is. Just a moment.
It's for you.
</p>

<p>
I told 'em at the office
that I might stop by.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much.
It's all right.
</p>

<p>
Yeah? What?
</p>

<p>
Well, where was it?
</p>

<p>
Yes, I understand,
but why are you calling me for?
</p>

<p>
Oh. Okay, I'll be right down.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Mmm.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Listen, I'm sorry.
I gotta run.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Gee, it's always somethir.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
This highway patrolman,
he found a girl in a car.
</p>

<p>
Ran over a cliff to Malibu Canyon.
</p>

<p>
Dead.
</p>

<p>
You get all sorts of cases,
don't you?
Yeah, listen.
</p>

<p>
They won't let me live.
What are you gonna do?
</p>

<p>
Uh, I'm sorry.
L-I didn't mean to fall asleep here.
</p>

<p>
I hope I didn't bother you too much.
It's all right.
</p>

<p>
Get some rest.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Columbo]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mrs. Mathews?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, Lieutenant Columbo!
How are ya?
</p>

<p>
I'm fine.
Good. Listen,
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kingston and the attorney
said it was all right
if I dropped by.
</p>

<p>
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no! Of course not.
</p>

<p>
The more, the merrier.
But it&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
it does seem such a shame
to hear poor Rudy this way.
</p>

<p>
All those ' whereases."
</p>

<p>
It won't sound like him at all.
</p>

<p>
You know, lawyers
always have a way of makir&#x2026;
It's like an old movie&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
with all the barristers
and the butlers
and the discarded wives&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
all gathering together
in the library to hear the will read.
</p>

<p>
Oh! Perhaps we'd better go.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It's never bothered me&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;till just about two months ago.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Really? You know, I have a friend&#x2026;
He wasn't always
a very nice man, you know.
</p>

<p>
Just business, business, business.
</p>

<p>
And then collecting.
Oh!
</p>

<p>
Collecting like some old pack rat.
</p>

<p>
But how anyone
could want to kill Rudy, I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh, hello, Dale.
Edna, darling.
</p>

<p>
How are you?
Hello, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kingston.
What have you got there this time,
a pink rabbit?
</p>

<p>
Oh, this? No, no, not really.
But it is something
that I wanted to show you.
</p>

<p>
Oh, show me too.
Edna, my dear.
</p>

<p>
Frank.
Dale.
</p>

<p>
And Lt. Columbo.
We can begin now.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Evans and his wife
are here already.
</p>

<p>
But Lieutenant was just going
to show us&#x2026;
Never mind. He'll show me.
</p>

<p>
We'll join you in a little while.
Thank you, Frank.
</p>

<p>
I hope you're feeling better, Edna.
</p>

<p>
What do you think?
</p>

<p>
It's frightful.
That's what I figured.
</p>

<p>
But you know what?
I thought maybe you just might
recognize the style or the signature.
</p>

<p>
No.
Who on earth is Tracy?
</p>

<p>
Well, do you remember the other night
when I had to leave your place in a hurry?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes, that highway patrol thing.
Some kind of an accident, wasn't it?
</p>

<p>
That's what it looked like.
But you see, I told&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I said whenever a case comes up
that has anything to do
with art or painting, you call me.
</p>

<p>
Now, wait a minute.
You mean it wasn't an accident?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah, it's an accident.
I mean, that's what it's listed as.
</p>

<p>
But, anyway, you see, the dead girl,
she was some kind of an art student.
</p>

<p>
And I thought, well, who knows,
maybe you knew something about her.
</p>

<p>
Tracy O'Connor?
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, there must be
over 100,000 art students
in Southern California.
</p>

<p>
Well, you see,
I remember seeir one of those
lecture schedules in your apartment.
</p>

<p>
And a couple of months ago,
you gave several lectures
in the school where this girl was enrolled.
</p>

<p>
This is what she looks like.
Be realistic, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
You think I can remember
everyone who ever sat in
on one of my lectures?
</p>

<p>
I've never seen that girl before
in my life. Why don't you stop
wasting everybody's time?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;These are all minor details.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Sit down, Dale, won't you?
Thank you, Frank.
</p>

<p>
'For their devoted service to me&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
for the past 10 y&#x2026;"
</p>

<p>
Uh, Lieutenant, why don't you
make yourself comfortable.
</p>

<p>
We've uh, skimmed over the preliminaries.
We're now down to the salient points.
</p>

<p>
Proceed as you wish, Counselor.
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
'For their devoted service to me

Such a kind man.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;"Finally, to,&lt;/i&gt; uh&#x2026;
&lt;i&gt;to my primary heir of all previous wills,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to my nephew Dale Kingston,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;"whom I once supported&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;through college&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;"and who has had the full freedom&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of my home and possessions&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;ever since without thought of recompense,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
'I bequeath the full bulk and remainder
of my estate&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
'with this one single exception:
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;"To Edna Mathews,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the wife whom I mistakenly&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;divorced 15 years ago,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;"I bequeath&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;my entire art collection,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
[Gasps]
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Including all of those paintings listed&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in the so-called Mathews Collection. "
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mr. Kingston! Oh, no!</li>
<li>&lt;i&gt;[Simpson] If you please.&lt;/i&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;This will is properly signed and&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;witnessed as of the 10th oflast month.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Here. I think you all
should take a look at these.
</p>

<p>
Dale, I'm sorry.
L-I'm really sorry.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Oh, no.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Don't be silly, Aunt Edna.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
All it means is that I'll now
be able to criticize your collection
like I used to criticize his.
</p>

<p>
Thank you, Frank.
Mm-hmm.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mathews, I hope&#x2026;
This is just such a surprise.
We are&#x2026; I'm happy for you.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I know you'll be pleased with it.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I'm sure you will.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I wasn't prepared for that.
Nope. Really is a shock.
</p>

<p>
File those, would you, please?
I tried to talk Rudy out of it, naturally.
</p>

<p>
He always intended to leave
that collection to Dale.
</p>

<p>
Then, give it to her.
</p>

<p>
That's why I thought
you'd like to be here.
</p>

<p>
Legally, I couldn't say anything until&#x2026;
Oh, sure. I understand that.
</p>

<p>
It's just that
that was a new will?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Only last month?&lt;/i&gt;
That's correct.
He wrote most of it himself.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Oh, he promised to let me&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;draw up something more detailed&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and complete later on, but&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Boy, I can't figure it. L&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
You'd think the nephew
would get the paintings.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I agree. I agree.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Mr. Mathews had&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;disagreements with Dale,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;but an art collection like that&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;is big business.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
To manage that requires
specialized skill, taste.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Why he'd simply leave the whole thing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to a poor, unstable creature like&lt;/i&gt; Ed&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Those comments are hardly
professional of me, are they?
</p>

<p>
One thing, though.
</p>

<p>
If Mr. Kingston doesn't get the collection,
he at least gets the rest of the estate.
&lt;i&gt;It's meaningless.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
He rented that big house.
</p>

<p>
Rudy disposed of all his business interests.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;There really isn't any&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;remaining estate to speak of.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh.
</p>

<p>
Well, listen, uh,
thanks for lettir me come down.
</p>

<p>
I gotta get back to work.
&lt;i&gt;Uh, Lieutenant?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Your painting.
Oh, thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Lieutenant?
My lighter.
</p>

<p>
Oh.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
</p>

<p>
[Sighs]
Miss Henderson,
I'll make my calls now, please.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Kingston]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Looking for me, Lieutenant?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh. Yeah, I thought
I'd kind of catch you
out in the parking lot.
</p>

<p>
Expect you'd find me there
kicking my tires in frustration,
I suppose?
</p>

<p>
Well, I thought there'd be
the normal amount of disappointment.
You are so transparent, Columbo.
</p>

<p>
You had this thing all figured out
right from the start, haven't you?
</p>

<p>
Dale Kingston hired someone
to fake the theft and kill his uncle.
</p>

<p>
Maybe even some
poor little art student, perhaps.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kingston, I never said that.
And even though I had
an ain'tight alibi by total accident,
</p>

<p>
at the time of my uncle's murder,
that still didn't stop you, did it?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kingston, really, I&#x2026;
Well, at this point,
</p>

<p>
I'm sure that even a compulsively
suspicious bureaucrat like you&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;must have his doubts&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;about my guilt.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Because you heard it up there,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mr. Columbo.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You heard it in plain English.
I do not inerit.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Edna does.&lt;/i&gt;
That's very true, Mr. Kingston.
</p>

<p>
That's very true, except&#x2026;
&lt;i&gt;Except what?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Well, maybe you didn't know that
your uncle changed his will.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that,
</p>

<p>
because, you see,
I've known for more than 10 days&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;that I couldn't possibly inerit&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;any part of that collection.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
But since you won't believe me,
maybe you'll believe my uncle.
</p>

<p>
Go on. I'm sure
somebody in your department&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
is capable of verifying
that signature.
</p>

<p>
Go on, read it.
</p>

<p>
He sent me that letter 10 days ago
telling me about the new will.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Look at the postmark.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So you did know?</li>
<li>Of course I knew.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, would you please
do me a favor
and stop pestering me&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and go on out and do what you
should've done in the first place, huh?
</p>

<p>
Find the real killer!
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Woman]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant, I'm not a busybody.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I never said that.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Yeah, well, some landlords
like to pry into the lives
of their tenants, but not me.
</p>

<p>
My policy is live and let live.
</p>

<p>
Come on. What's bothering Walter?
He won't eat?
Well, maybe he's not hungry.
</p>

<p>
Listen, it's not that you're a busybody.
You live here and you see things.
</p>

<p>
I mean, how can you live here
and not see things?
Such as?
</p>

<p>
Well, who goes out with who
and who's doing what.
All those things.
</p>

<p>
Oh.
This girl, Tracy O'Connor,
who did she go out with?
</p>

<p>
Come on. Tell me.
She dated, didn't she?
Oh, of course she dated.
</p>

<p>
Oh, you know, that was
a terrible shame about that accident.
</p>

<p>
That was a very talented girl.
Very.
</p>

<p>
Well, you oughta know.
You took one of her paintings
the last time you were here.
</p>

<p>
She was a very gifted girl.
You're darn right.
</p>

<p>
And it was a shame about the accident.
Right.
</p>

<p>
You know why I hated
to give up the painting?
Well, why did you give it up?
</p>

<p>
I had to.
What for?
</p>

<p>
Well, that was evidence.
Evidence for what?
</p>

<p>
Listen, I don't wanna get into that.
That's too complicated.
Walter, come here.
</p>

<p>
Come here, boy.
Don't-Don't-Don't-Don't do that!
</p>

<p>
Why not?
Walter doesn't like strangers.
He'll bite.
</p>

<p>
Will he? Oh.
It was an accident, wasn't it?
</p>

<p>
Listen, are you gonna tell me
about the men in her life or not?
</p>

<p>
All right, the men.
Now, remember,
</p>

<p>
I wasn't particularly trying
to find out about her,
</p>

<p>
but I do remember one or two.
</p>

<p>
There was an actor fella.
There were a couple
of those beach types.
</p>

<p>
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
And there was a kid that played&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
You want me to tell you the truth?
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
I'm interested in one guy in particular.
Who?
</p>

<p>
Forty years old, well dressed,
distinguished.
</p>

<p>
Wait a minute.
Now, wait a minute.
</p>

<p>
Come to think of it,
there was one older gentleman
she was seeing.
</p>

<p>
Really? Can you describe him?
</p>

<p>
Would a picture help?
</p>

<p>
A picture?
Are ya kidding?
Mm-mmm.
</p>

<p>
You have a picture of this fella?
Yeah, it's around here someplace
if I haven't thrown it away.
</p>

<p>
It's probably in my album.
</p>

<p>
Where did you get a photograph of him?
</p>

<p>
Well, I was taking
some snapshots of my nephew
out at the pool.
</p>

<p>
And Tracy and her friend
were out there,
so I took one of them too.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure it's in one of these.
You're a lifesaver.
</p>

<p>
Well, let's see.
</p>

<p>
Oh! Here was one.
That's when my cousins
were out here from Milwaukee.
</p>

<p>
We stopped at one of those
roadside stands, you know,
for date malts.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I got so sick,
but they're awful good.
Have you ever had one?
</p>

<p>
Think you'd like 'em.
</p>

<p>
Oh, there's Cindy Lou.
That's my cousirs kid.
</p>

<p>
She's named for me. Look at her.
That's at Graumars Chinese.
</p>

<p>
She's trying to fit her feet into the&#x2026;
you know, the things in the concrete.
</p>

<p>
That's awful cute.
I made her that dress.
</p>

<p>
Doesn't that look nice?
Um&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Can you see&#x2026;
Well, let's see, now.
</p>

<p>
Oh! Here's a whole bunch of us
that went out to the family plot
and had a picnic.
</p>

<p>
We did some weeding and planting.
We had the best time.
[Clears Throat]
</p>

<p>
We had more laughs&#x2026;
Look, isn't that cute?
That's my Uncle Henry there.
</p>

<p>
Oh.
Now, wait a minute.
We must&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Do you have any&#x2026;
That's a nice one too. Look at that.
That was taken at the zoo.
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a good one of a lion?
Wonderful. Do you have any idea&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Now, wait a minute.
Oh-oh, here it is. Here you go.
There. Well, there he is.
</p>

<p>
That's the one.
Any help? No kidding?
</p>

<p>
That's not him.
Oh, I'm sorry.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Man]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You guys still guarding this place?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Gardener]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Just me. I keep the tourists away.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Say, uh, you know anything
about aphids?
</p>

<p>
Aphids?
Yeah, they're destroying my roses.
</p>

<p>
My wife doesn't want me
to use any pesticides.
Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Hard spray from your garden hose
around 4:00 or 5:00 p.m.
</p>

<p>
Uh, the surs still hot enough
to dry,
</p>

<p>
and it won't burn your flowers.
</p>

<p>
Just water, huh?
</p>

<p>
Thanks. I'll try it.
Okay.
</p>

<p>
Hey! Come here!
</p>

<p>
Look at this!
</p>

<p>
Your ex-husband lived
right up there, didn't he?
</p>

<p>
Uh, y-yes, right up there on the hill,
</p>

<p>
brooding down on me like Zeus.
</p>

<p>
When we were married,
I always used to like this house.
</p>

<p>
As soon as we got divorced,
I moved in.
</p>

<p>
But for years, Rudy and I couldn't
have been farther away from each other&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
if I'd bought a house on the Moon.
</p>

<p>
Are you sure
you wouldn't like a drink?
Oh, no.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much.
Are they real?
</p>

<p>
Yes.
May I?
</p>

<p>
Oh, of course.
Help yourself.
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
So, uh, what changed all that?
</p>

<p>
I mean, how did you and Rudy
get to seeing one another again?
</p>

<p>
Well, we just bumped into each other
a couple of months ago.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And, well, we were older&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;and he wasn't&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;quite so stuffy anymore.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
And maybe I don't throw things&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
like parties and handsome Italians
quite so much.
</p>

<p>
Ma'am, I know you're in a hurry.
You wanna go shopping.
</p>

<p>
But I wondered first
if we could talk about&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;But you want to know&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;about that will thing.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Of course.
L-I don't blame you.
</p>

<p>
Uh, but don't misunderstand.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Rudy and I werert starting&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;to sing September songs&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;or anything like that.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
But&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Well, you see, years ago&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I used to think I was artistic,
</p>

<p>
and I literally dragged him
into his first museum.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And that's how&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;his whole collection all began.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Because naturally, Rudy started
sensing a good investment area.
</p>

<p>
And some of the paintings
I liked werert too bad.
</p>

<p>
But it was my understanding that
it was his nephew
who picked out all his paintings.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes, later on.
</p>

<p>
But Dale was just in college then.
</p>

<p>
Uh, that was just about the time when&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
when I started misbehaving.
</p>

<p>
And then, of course,
after our divorce, the collection
became an obsession with Rudy&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
and a whole career for Dale.
</p>

<p>
So since you were in at the beginning,
Mr. Mathews last month decided
to leave the whole collection to you?
</p>

<p>
But he didn't want me to keep them.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;You don't think that, do you?&lt;/i&gt;
Well&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh, dear.
I guess nobody's going to understand.
</p>

<p>
[Stammering]
No. You see,
</p>

<p>
poor Rudy was finally tired of it,
that's all&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
all the greedy buying
and bidding and hoarding.
</p>

<p>
He finally&#x2026;
He finally agreed with me&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that the people should own
those lovely things
instead of just collectors.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;He decided to give them all away&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;to schools, museums.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh! But, oh, dear,
</p>

<p>
it takes so much time to work that out&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
to decide which places
get which.
</p>

<p>
And in the meantime, he didn't want
Dale Kingston to get his hands on it.
Is that it?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I don't like to say that.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I was just so happy that
Rudy was finally turning human.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Doorbell Rings]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Who on Earth&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Hello, Aunt Edna. May I come in?
How are you, dear?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;I didn't think you'd even remember&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;where I lived.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Of course I do.
Got a message from a Lt. Col&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh, there you are.
What's this all about?
</p>

<p>
Is it about the gun?
What?
</p>

<p>
Wait a minute.
What gun? What is all this?
</p>

<p>
Well, I thought you'd be interested.
About a half hour ago,
</p>

<p>
a gardener up on that hill there,
</p>

<p>
he found a.38 revolver,
</p>

<p>
and it's the same kind as the one
that was missing from your uncle's desk.
</p>

<p>
Uh, may I use your phone?
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes, of course.
</p>

<p>
Isn't that silly?
Right up above my house.
</p>

<p>
L-I've walked on that hill myself.
</p>

<p>
Ballistics.
</p>

<p>
Is this Charlie?
Lt. Columbo.
</p>

<p>
Charlie, I sent that stuff over there
over a half hour ago&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Oh. Thank you.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's the murder gun, all right.</li>
<li>Oh.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oh, there's nothing to be upset about.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Edna]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;But I was just telling Dale,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
l-I go up there myself
when I want a breath of air.
</p>

<p>
I even walked over to see Rudy
just the night before he was killed.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Edna, I don't think
you oughta say another word.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;The lieutenant may get&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the wrong idea.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;What?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, but-but surely
no one would think that I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Threw that gun there?
Oh, no, Mrs. Mathews.
No, no, no, no, no.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;No, you see,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I finally figured out what happened.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Whoever was in that house that night,
they ran out the back.
They just kept on going.
</p>

<p>
Well, naturally, they were anxious
to get rid of your ex-husband's gun.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;It could've been anybody.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
It could?
&lt;i&gt;Yes. Absolutely, it could.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
You have nothing to worry about.
Now, did you wanna go shopping?
</p>

<p>
Well, I was planning to meet
some friends at the fashion center,
but I can do that some other time.
</p>

<p>
No, I want you to go right ahead,
</p>

<p>
and I want you
to forget about all this.
</p>

<p>
Just do what my wife does,
'cause when she hits
a department store,
</p>

<p>
she can forget anything,
even the fact that
I'm sittir outside waiting.
</p>

<p>
Have a good time, Edna.
Bye.
</p>

<p>
What are you trying to do to her?
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
Well, you know perfectly well&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that it was a woman that ran out
of that place that night.
</p>

<p>
You said so yourself.
Yeah, sure, but not her.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I hope
you really mean that, Lieutenant&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that you're not just playing
some kind of a game with her.
</p>

<p>
A game?
Yes. You know what I mean.
</p>

<p>
Lulling her into
a sense of false security.
Edna's a very vulnerable woman.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kingston,
you've got me all wrong, really.
I wouldn't think of a thing like that.
</p>

<p>
That lady wouldn't hurt a fly.
&lt;i&gt;[Man]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Can you come around here for a minute?
</p>

<p>
You told me not to bother you
until she'd gone.
</p>

<p>
What is it?
Well, we found something else.
</p>

<p>
She's got some trash cans back here.
</p>

<p>
'Rudy Mathews,
417 Pine View."
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Looks like that piece of wrapping paper&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that was torn from the rest of it&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in his house. Remember?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;We figured the thief used it.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
All right, you'd better
get that down for fingerprinting
and comparison with the other paper.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Is there anything else?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
No, we've covered
every inch of the grounds.
</p>

<p>
Be careful with that.
</p>

<p>
Now what?
I don't know.
</p>

<p>
I know what you're thinking, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
The gun,
and now this new evidence.
</p>

<p>
Looks pretty bad for her.
Yes, it does. Yes.
</p>

<p>
I'm still convinced that Edna
had absolutely nothing to do with this.
</p>

<p>
You know,
I think I agree with ya.
</p>

<p>
Look at it this way.
If she's really guilty,
</p>

<p>
she's not gonna put that paper
in a garbage can, is she?
</p>

<p>
I mean, she's probably gonna
burn it in the fireplace or somethir.
</p>

<p>
Yes, exactly.
That's the point.
</p>

<p>
And you know something else,
Mr. Kingston?
You're absolutely right about her.
</p>

<p>
She's a&#x2026;
What did you call it before?
</p>

<p>
Vulnerable.
Vulnerable, yes.
She's a vulnerable woman.
</p>

<p>
And I'm afraid that
if I press her too hard,
</p>

<p>
she'll fall apart.
Oh, yes.
</p>

<p>
And I sure don't wanna make
the same mistake
that I made with you.
</p>

<p>
No, sir.
What I'm gonna do is this.
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna sit on everything
until those stolen paintings show up.
I see.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I mean, that's the best way</li>
</ul>
<p>
to handle it, don't you think?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Yes, yes, of course.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I mean, I don't wanna go around
pointing my finger at anyone
until I have an ain'tight case.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Right?</li>
<li>Right.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Uh, Lieutenant,
</p>

<p>
your man said that you'd, uh&#x2026;
you'd covered every&#x2026;
every inch of the place here.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Did that include the inside of the house?&lt;/i&gt;
Well, she gave us permission,
but I don't wanna bother.
</p>

<p>
Well, don't you think you should?
</p>

<p>
I mean, for her protection.
</p>

<p>
And when you fail to find the paintings,
you can cross her name off the list entirely.
</p>

<p>
Well, it hardly seems won'th the trouble.
Neither of us thinks she's guilty.
Why bother?
</p>

<p>
Well, for her sake so she can be certain.
Search the house, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
No, really,
I think it's a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;But if anything new comes up,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I'll let you know.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Starts Engine]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Edna? She's utterly harmless.
</p>

<p>
Exactly.
That's why we've got to help her.
</p>

<p>
But is there really
any danger of her arrest?
</p>

<p>
You told me yourself
the lieutenant doesn't think she's guilty.
</p>

<p>
That's today, Frank.
Who knows what he'll think tomorrow?
</p>

<p>
In case you haven't noticed,
he is a very haphazard individual.
</p>

<p>
Hmm. And if he doesn't
break the case soon?
Exactly.
</p>

<p>
He starts looking for a scapegoat
because the pressure's
building up on him,
</p>

<p>
and Edna's the most
obvious candidate.
</p>

<p>
Well, what should we do?
</p>

<p>
Protect her.
I'm sure Rudy would've wanted
both of us to look out for her interests.
</p>

<p>
She trusts you, Frank.
</p>

<p>
Get her in here.
Talk to her like a Dutch uncle.
Fill her in on the situation.
</p>

<p>
You're sure we should
allow her house to be searched?
</p>

<p>
Absolutely. In fact,
I think you ought to recommend
that we insist on it.
</p>

<p>
And that way, we get it on the record
that nothing has been found
to incriminate her.
</p>

<p>
All right. Miss Henderson,
get me Mrs. Mathews.
</p>

<p>
Oh, uh, she's shopping
at the fashion center in Beverly Hills.
</p>

<p>
You could bring her in here right now
and clarify this whole thing.
</p>

<p>
Miss Henderson, have her paged
at the fashion center.
We'll clear it up today.
</p>

<p>
Well, there may be
one small hitch to that.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Lt. Columbo
refuses to search the house.
</p>

<p>
He claims it to be a waste of time.
&lt;i&gt;Oh?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Which merely perpetuates
Edna's anxiety.
</p>

<p>
I really wish there was something
we could do about that man, Frank.
</p>

<p>
Well, perhaps there's, um,
some way around him.
</p>

<p>
You really think so?
</p>

<p>
I have a few friends at city hall.
Let me look into it.
</p>

<p>
Fine. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
I'll just run one little errand,
and I'll be right back.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Fine. Fine.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Uh, Miss Henderson,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;after I talk to Mrs. Mathews,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I want the police department.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Dale?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Edna does have an excellent motive.
</p>

<p>
You, uh&#x2026; You don't think
there's any chance&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Of course not.
</p>

<p>
You oughta be ashamed of yourself, Frank.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. Sorry.
</p>

<p>
I just don't understand any of this.
</p>

<p>
It's just a precautionary measure,
Aunt Edna, nothing more.
</p>

<p>
But what do you want them
to search my house for?
</p>

<p>
What will they find?
Absolutely nothing.
That's just the point.
</p>

<p>
Now, come on.
</p>

<p>
Frank.
Mm-hmm.
</p>

<p>
Where, uh&#x2026;
Where do you want me to put these?
</p>

<p>
Oh, uh, in there.
</p>

<p>
Anywhere.
Oh, I need a drink.
</p>

<p>
Of course you do, darling.
So do I. Let me fix it for you.
</p>

<p>
Here are your keys.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Still scotch?&lt;/i&gt;
Yes.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;How about you, Frank?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A drink?&lt;/i&gt;
Yes, on the rocks, please.
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry we have to
put you through this now.
But believe me,
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;it'll all be over soon, huh?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Why would anyone think that
I'd want to kill Rudy?
&lt;i&gt;Nobody does.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
We just wanna make sure
that it stays that way, that's all.
</p>

<p>
That's why Frank is having the police
come in and search the house.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Believe me, it's all for the best.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Dale, I don't even remember
what happened&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
the night Rudy was killed.
</p>

<p>
I get so nervous,
l-I take sleeping pills sometimes.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That's one thing you should&#x2026;</li>
</ul>
<p>
[Yells]
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Oh!</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oh! Excuse me.
Oh!
</p>

<p>
Let me just dry off.
I'll be right back.
</p>

<p>
Oh!
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Edna]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, isn't that a shame?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Uh, Frank&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Doorbell Rings]&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Frank, must we go through this?
</p>

<p>
Edna, you will be
so much better off&#x2026;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&lt;i&gt;[Doorbell Rings]&lt;/i&gt;</li>
<li>Come on. Come on.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Nothing to be nervous about now.
</p>

<p>
Go ahead.
</p>

<p>
Miss Mathews?
Captain Wyler, police department.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Edna]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Yes. Please, come in.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Wyler]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Sorry. You can't go in there.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Columbo]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I'm a lieutenant,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;so, do you mind?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
It's okay, Ferguson.
Let him in.
</p>

<p>
Hi, Captain.
Columbo.
</p>

<p>
Uh&#x2026; Oh, hi, Mr. Kingston.
Hello, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Listen, I just heard about this.
Word came down from above
to have the place searched.
</p>

<p>
Is that so?
Yeah. And I can't
understand why.
</p>

<p>
The fact is,
I was kind of bypassed
when I came over here.
</p>

<p>
Well, apparently you're
just not needed here then, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Why don't you just go home
and have your dinner?
</p>

<p>
Oh, no, I'd better hang around,
because, you know,
</p>

<p>
if I leave now,
it looks bad upstairs, you know.
</p>

<p>
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
Oh, hello, Mrs. Mathews.
Mr. Simpson.
&lt;i&gt;Hi.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Gee, I hope this is not
upsetting you too much.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm not very happy&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;about my house&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;being torn apart.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&lt;i&gt;But they advised me to do it.&lt;/i&gt;</li>
<li>They?</li>

<li>&lt;i&gt;Who is "they"?&lt;/i&gt;</li>
<li>Mr. Kingston and I</li>
</ul>
<p>
thought it was necessary, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I see.
Oh.
</p>

<p>
It's really very confusing.
</p>

<p>
You said you didn't suspect me
of anything, didn't you?
</p>

<p>
Yes, I did, ma'am,
and I meant that.
</p>

<p>
And, actually,
I was opposed to&#x2026;
Captain Wyler.
</p>

<p>
Clear this table.
</p>

<p>
Where'd you find those?
</p>

<p>
Linen closet in the hallway.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Edna, how could you?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;[Gasps]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dale, believe me,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
I have no idea how they got there!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You'd better not say another word.</li>
<li>But&#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
Edna, he's right.
</p>

<p>
Do you intend
to charge her formally, Captain?
</p>

<p>
It's up to Lt. Columbo.
It's his case.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;What do you mean it's his case?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I thought it was&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;We know what you thought,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mr. Kingston.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Well, I think we can
get started with the fingerprinting.
Let's get the kit.
</p>

<p>
Careful, there.
Be very careful.
</p>

<p>
Gee, they're something,
aren't they?
</p>

<p>
Pastels, you know.
</p>

<p>
May I ask
what this is all about, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Both of'em.
&lt;i&gt;Lieutenant?&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mr. Kingston.
Uh, yes, just give us a moment, please.
Do you mind?
</p>

<p>
We're getting a few.
Good.
</p>

<p>
I'd like an answer, if you don't mind.
</p>

<p>
Uh, well, I'd have to start
with your uncle's will.
</p>

<p>
What about it?
</p>

<p>
Well, you see, he pulled a rug
out from under you when
he left his collection to Mrs. Mathews.
</p>

<p>
So you only had
one thing that you could do&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
murder him and blame it on her.
</p>

<p>
I hope you realize the full import
of what you're saying, Lieutenant.
There are witnesses here.
</p>

<p>
You see, under the law,
</p>

<p>
anyone who criminally causes
the death of someone else
can't inerit from that person.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Is that right, Mr. Simpson?&lt;/i&gt;
That's correct.
</p>

<p>
So if Mrs. Mathews is convicted,
you're next in line.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Everything goes to you.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;That's why you planted the gun,&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
and that's why
you planted the wrapping paper,
</p>

<p>
and that's why
you planted these paintings.
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;Dale! I can't believe it!&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
But you'd like to, wouldn't you?
</p>

<p>
Get you right off the hook.
</p>

<p>
All right, Lieutenant.
You claimed that I planted these paintings?
Suppose you prove it.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can we?</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yeah&#x2026; with fingerprints.
</p>

<p>
Sorry to disappoint you, Lieutenant.
Fingerprints won't help you at all.
</p>

<p>
My fingerprints are all over
those paintings.
</p>

<p>
My uncle and I unwrapped them
when they came back from the exhibit.
I told you, didn't I?
</p>

<p>
I told you myself.
They're covered with my prints.
</p>

<p>
No, we're not looking for your prints.
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
Do you remember the time
that I was in your apartment,
and you came in with some paintings?
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;And you said that they were watercolors,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and you wanted to evaluate 'em.&lt;/i&gt;
</p>

<p>
And remember I wanted to see 'em,
and you wouldn't let me?
And I even touched 'em.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You touched&#x2026;</li>
<li>Yes, my fingerprints</li>
</ul>
<p>
are on those paintings.
</p>

<p>
Now, if Mrs. Mathews is guilty,
</p>

<p>
how could my fingerprints
get on paintings that she stole?
</p>

<p>
Uh, this is entrapment.
</p>

<p>
It's a setup, that's all.
</p>

<p>
You-You-You-You touched
those paintings just now
while I wasn't looking.
</p>

<p>
You saw him do it, didn't you?
You put your prints on those paintings&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
while you were bent over watching them
while they were working on it!
</p>

<p>
&lt;i&gt;He touched them!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You touched&#x2026; You&#x2026;&lt;/i&gt;

<p>
Get on with it.

Yes, of course.

<p>
you have to come through
for me tonight.
</p>

<p>
Oh, that. He's dead already.
</p>

<p>
[Clanging]
</p>

<p>
[Car engine starting]
</p>

<p>
[People chattering]
</p>

<p>
Eileen.
</p>

<p>
Eileen, you look gorgeous.
Give me a kiss.
</p>

<p>
I take every opportunity,
you know.
</p>

<p>
Hellos and goodbyes
are the only kisses I get.
</p>

<p>
Well, have you met
all the great,
</p>

<p>
and near-great, and so on
and so on?
</p>

<p>
I sure have.
</p>

<p>
It's a fine bunch of people
you have here, too.
</p>

<p>
This party is
partly for you, you know.
</p>

<p>
To impress you enough
to come and join
</p>

<p>
the Neal Publishing house.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Neal, I don't need
impressing. I'm ready.
</p>

<p>
We told Riley Greenleaf
today.
</p>

<p>
Allen's contract is up
in three weeks,
</p>

<p>
and then we're free.
</p>

<p>
And I assume Riley
took it with good grace.
</p>

<p>
Oh, of course,
aside from apoplexy.
</p>

<p>
Would you want to
lose the author
of five bestsellers?
</p>

<p>
Oh, hardly, hardly. Miss,
will you take this, please?
</p>

<p>
Listen, I hope you can join
me for dinner tonight.
You and Eileen, both.
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry, I can't.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps just you?
</p>

<p>
Oh, thanks.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
Uh-oh.
Has somebody arrived?
</p>

<p>
I invited Norman Mailer.
</p>

<p>
Yes, but did you
invite him?
</p>

<p>
Oh, there you are.
</p>

<p>
Don't move.
</p>

<p>
Not that I know of.
</p>

<p>
He looks a little
tanked up.
</p>

<p>
You better ignore him.
</p>

<p>
Ignore a tarantula?
</p>

<p>
You're lovely. Leave.
</p>

<p>
Well, there they are.
The Holy Trinity.
</p>

<p>
The only thing missing
is the golden glow.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, my presence
shall make up for that.
</p>

<p>
Nice of you
to drop in, Riley.
</p>

<p>
My pleasure. My pleasure.
</p>

<p>
I was curious to see
what mysterious lures
</p>

<p>
the great Geoffrey Neal
was using to steal
</p>

<p>
my pocket-sized Hemingway.
</p>

<p>
Riley, please.
</p>

<p>
Oh, there she is,
the lovely handmaiden.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
Literary agent and concubine,
</p>

<p>
ever present
at her master's side,
</p>

<p>
an inspiring muse
with real flesh.
</p>

<p>
All right, cut it out.
Don't you understand?
</p>

<p>
I don't want
a contract with you anymore.
</p>

<p>
After four years
of grinding out
some of that garbage you&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Garbage? Oh, no, no, sir,
that was sex.
</p>

<p>
And sex is our only mysticism
</p>

<p>
in this world today of
the new illiterates&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Our old contract is up
in three weeks,
</p>

<p>
and that's it, Riley.
</p>

<p>
Your relationship
does seem terminal, Riley.
</p>

<p>
He was writing obituaries
</p>

<p>
for the Pasadena News
when I found him,
</p>

<p>
and I alone made
him into a bestseller.
</p>

<p>
And now he would like to
write better things&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
[laughing]
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;and for Mr. Neal's company.
</p>

<p>
Oh, you're kidding.
</p>

<p>
My dear friend,
if you do, you will die.
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry Riley,
but I think it's best
</p>

<p>
if you keep
your next appointment.
</p>

<p>
His new book belongs to me,
</p>

<p>
and I've got him
under contract.
</p>

<p>
All right.
That'll be enough for now.
</p>

<p>
Well,
I'll tell you one thing.
</p>

<p>
He'll never write for you
</p>

<p>
or anyone else,
and I shall see to it.
</p>

<p>
Good night,
you charming people.
</p>

<p>
[Engine shutting off]
</p>

<p>
[Banging]
</p>

<p>
[Pounding]
</p>

<p>
(Greenleaf)
Hey.
</p>

<p>
[All laughing]
</p>

<p>
Hey, bartender!
</p>

<p>
If you don't mind,
a little less conversation,
</p>

<p>
a little more service
at the end of this bar.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
What did you
put in this glass?
</p>

<p>
That's a double Scotch
and soda, sir.
</p>

<p>
Just what you ordered.
</p>

<p>
What do you take me for,
some kind of a fool?
</p>

<p>
This tastes like bile.
</p>

<p>
Hey! Hey!
</p>

<p>
Come on. Let go of me.
</p>

<p>
I think you've had
enough for tonight, sir.
</p>

<p>
Oh, really?
I'll be the judge of that.
</p>

<p>
Let go of me.
</p>

<p>
Here.
</p>

<p>
Buy yourself a personality.
</p>

<p>
Let go.
Stop manhandling me.
</p>

<p>
Stinking joint!
</p>

<p>
You and this place
deserve to be in the Valley.
</p>

<p>
(Mallory)
Good morning, Agnes.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday's pages
looked okay.
</p>

<p>
I found a few errors
you can fix up here.
</p>

<p>
Let's pick it up
from Page 479,
</p>

<p>
and that should wrap it up
for the first draft.
</p>

<p>
Conrad held Li Chen
close against him
</p>

<p>
feeling her soft trembling
body yield to his embrace.
</p>

<p>
(Mallory)
He knew that this
must be love.
</p>

<p>
If it wasn't,
</p>

<p>
it would have to do
until the war was over.
</p>

<p>
(Mallory)
Conrad prowled the room
</p>

<p>
looking for the inside
of his personal tunnel.
</p>

<p>
There was no sleep
for him that night.
</p>

<p>
It was only 60 miles
to Saigon, he thought.
</p>

<p>
But how far could he ever
put Saigon behind him?
</p>

<p>
But there was only one
real decision to be reached,
</p>

<p>
and it had been formed
a long time ago.
</p>

<p>
He knew which way
he would have to turn.
</p>

<p>
Out across the plains was
the monastery of St. Ignatius,
</p>

<p>
offering him hope
and a chance to wash away
</p>

<p>
the wounds of war
that had brutalized him.
</p>

<p>
He turned to
look at Li Chen
</p>

<p>
sleeping on
the straw mattress,
</p>

<p>
her tiny body
heaving fitfully.
</p>

<p>
He would not wake her.
</p>

<p>
It was better that
she find him gone.
</p>

<p>
Saigon and
the fighting was far away.
</p>

<p>
From the window&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
[backfiring]
</p>

<p>
[Tires screeching]
</p>

<p>
What's the matter with you?
Hey, fool!
</p>

<p>
Look what you've
done to my car.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you.
</p>

<p>
What we've done
to your car?
</p>

<p>
Look what you've done
to our car. Tell him, Ralph.
</p>

<p>
Well, sir, you&#x2026; you&#x2026; you
did pull out without looking.
</p>

<p>
What?
</p>

<p>
That's ridiculous.
You, Ralphy, are a fool,
</p>

<p>
you're a liar,
</p>

<p>
and you're a menace
to your fellow man.
</p>

<p>
Don't take that
from him, Ralph.
</p>

<p>
And you, madam, shut up!
</p>

<p>
All right, here, Ralphy.
</p>

<p>
I suggest you
call that number
</p>

<p>
the first thing
in the morning.
</p>

<p>
That's my insurance agent.
</p>

<p>
He'll know how to
deal with you.
</p>

<p>
Sir, in your condition,
I should call the police.
</p>

<p>
Madam, in your condition,
I'd call a plastic surgeon.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
[Tires screeching]
</p>

<p>
Let's see,
it would have to be around&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I come to work at 10:00,
</p>

<p>
so that would have to
make it around midnight,
</p>

<p>
I guess. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Excuse me, coming through.
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. About&#x2026; About
midnight. L&#x2026; l&#x2026; I was&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
That's when I found him.
</p>

<p>
I was bringing him
his coffee.
</p>

<p>
Coffee?
Did you leave the building?
</p>

<p>
Oh, no, I keep it
down in the basement.
</p>

<p>
Hey,
did somebody mention coffee?
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I brought
Mr. Mallory's coffee.
</p>

<p>
I always brought him
his coffee, every night.
</p>

<p>
Yeah? You still got some?
</p>

<p>
Yeah, it's in the other room.
But it's probably cold by now.
</p>

<p>
That's all right.
I'd drink anything.
</p>

<p>
You know how much
sleep I've had
</p>

<p>
the last two nights?
Maybe five hours.
</p>

<p>
Last night it was
Bette Davis.
</p>

<p>
2:00 in the morning,
</p>

<p>
my wife wants to
watch Bette Davis.
</p>

<p>
So we're
watching Bette Davis.
</p>

<p>
Did you find out about
that key yet, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Oh, this is brutal.
</p>

<p>
Um, the key?
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Oh, no, the super,
he comes in at 7::00.
</p>

<p>
All right.
</p>

<p>
But, you know,
she is a terrific actress,
</p>

<p>
this woman Bette Davis.
Forget about it.
</p>

<p>
Um, excuse me.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Kramer?
</p>

<p>
(man)
Watch it. Coming through.
</p>

<p>
You finished up over here?
</p>

<p>
Just about, Lieutenant.
Just about.
</p>

<p>
How did he get in?
</p>

<p>
Who?
</p>

<p>
The guard.
</p>

<p>
How'd you get in, sir?
With a pass key?
</p>

<p>
Yeah, yeah. I knocked,
</p>

<p>
but I couldn't hear
anybody workin', you see?
</p>

<p>
But I could see the light
shining through the door.
</p>

<p>
That's when I come in,
and l&#x2026; and I found him.
</p>

<p>
Did you touch anything here?
</p>

<p>
You think I'm
some kind of a nut?
</p>

<p>
That's your job.
I've got problems of my own.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
this gentleman said
</p>

<p>
he came here
to see Mr. Mallory.
</p>

<p>
What's going on in here?
</p>

<p>
Who are you, sir?
</p>

<p>
Norman Wolpert.
Lewis Manuscript Service.
</p>

<p>
I'm here to pick up
Mr. Mallory's tape
</p>

<p>
for transcription.
</p>

<p>
Messenger service?
</p>

<p>
Manuscript service.
</p>

<p>
What are you doing here
at this hour?
</p>

<p>
Why do you come so late?
</p>

<p>
It's the same time
I come every night.
</p>

<p>
Yeah&#x2026; Yeah, that&#x2026;
that's right, Lieutenant.
L&#x2026; I can vouch for that.
</p>

<p>
Is Mr. Mallory all right?
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm afraid
Mr. Mallory is dead.
</p>

<p>
What happened?
</p>

<p>
That's what we're
trying to find out.
</p>

<p>
Lou, you take this
young man's statement.
</p>

<p>
You talk to this gentleman,
and then you can go home.
</p>

<p>
It's all yours, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Sweeney,
you getting anything here?
</p>

<p>
Not much. A lot of dust.
</p>

<p>
Leave this here.
</p>

<p>
(Mallory)
&#x2026;her tiny body
heaving fitfully.
</p>

<p>
He would not wake her.
</p>

<p>
It was better that
she find him gone.
</p>

<p>
(Young)
You need
the security guard anymore?
</p>

<p>
What was that?
</p>

<p>
Is it okay if I let him
go back to the lobby?
</p>

<p>
Yeah, let him go.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;from the window.
</p>

<p>
[Gun firing on tape]
</p>

<p>
[Clanking]
</p>

<p>
(policeman)
Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Shh.
</p>

<p>
Did you hear that?
</p>

<p>
They paid that
guy a lot of money
for writing that tripe.
</p>

<p>
Wait a minute.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
[Tape rewinding]
Wait a minute.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;from the window.
</p>

<p>
[Gun firing on tape]
</p>

<p>
[Clanking]
</p>

<p>
[Door closing]
</p>

<p>
We found this
in the basement corridor.
</p>

<p>
It's been fired.
</p>

<p>
[Sniffing]
</p>

<p>
Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Where did you say
you found it?
In the corridor?
</p>

<p>
You mean, it was just
laying there,
right out in the open?
</p>

<p>
That's right.
</p>

<p>
We also found
some jimmy marks
</p>

<p>
on the outside basement door.
</p>

<p>
That's how the guy
got in the building.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Sweeney,
prints, Ballistics, please.
</p>

<p>
Sure, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
I'm all through here, anyway.
</p>

<p>
Sweeney?
</p>

<p>
What, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Nothin'.
</p>

<p>
[Brakes screeching]
</p>

<p>
[Crickets chirping]
</p>

<p>
[Snoring]
</p>

<p>
(policeman)
Sir?
</p>

<p>
Sir?
</p>

<p>
What? What?
</p>

<p>
What?
What&#x2026; What&#x2026; What is it? What?
</p>

<p>
What're you doin' here
parked in the park?
</p>

<p>
'C-'Cause there's a sign
out there that said,
</p>

<p>
"No parking in the street."
</p>

<p>
Step out of your car,
please, sir.
</p>

<p>
Certainly&#x2026; Certainly not.
</p>

<p>
I am on my way home,
Officer.
</p>

<p>
So would you kindly
shut that door, please?
</p>

<p>
Please, uh, step out
of the car, sir.
</p>

<p>
[Sighing]
</p>

<p>
If you want me to
get out of this car,
</p>

<p>
Officer, or Sergeant,
</p>

<p>
you're gonna have to
drag me out.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
Uh, Fred?
</p>

<p>
Need help, huh?
</p>

<p>
Lt. Columbo?
</p>

<p>
How're you doing?
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I would like
my client released.
</p>

<p>
He's being treated
like a common criminal,
</p>

<p>
and I want to know why.
</p>

<p>
Well, there has been
a crime.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chase, is it?
</p>

<p>
David Chase.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Greenleaf?
</p>

<p>
Yes, that's right.
</p>

<p>
My name is Lt. Columbo.
</p>

<p>
Anybody want coffee?
</p>

<p>
No, I want to go home.
</p>

<p>
Why don't you just tell me
what the bail is,
</p>

<p>
and I'll take
Mr. Greenleaf home.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't know, sir.
</p>

<p>
I'm not connected
with the Traffic Division.
</p>

<p>
I'm attached to Homicide.
</p>

<p>
Homicide?
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
What is all this about?
</p>

<p>
I just wanna ask
Mr. Greenleaf
</p>

<p>
if he can
identify a voice for me.
</p>

<p>
Now, just a minute.
</p>

<p>
Won't take long.
</p>

<p>
(Mallory)
&#x2026;offering him hope
and a chance to wash away
</p>

<p>
the wounds of war
that had brutalized him.
</p>

<p>
He turned to
look at Li Chen
</p>

<p>
sleeping on
the straw mattress&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
It's Allen's voice.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;her tiny body
heaving fitfully.
</p>

<p>
He would not wake her.
</p>

<p>
It was better that
she find him gone.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it's Allen Mallory.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, he turned away&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
All right,
I've identified the voice.
</p>

<p>
Can I leave now?
</p>

<p>
[Gun firing on tape]
</p>

<p>
[Metallic clanging on tape]
</p>

<p>
That's right, sir.
I'm afraid this man is dead.
</p>

<p>
Oh, God, no.
</p>

<p>
But who? Why?
</p>

<p>
That's what I wanted
to ask you, Mr. Mr. Greenleaf.
</p>

<p>
The medical examiner
sets the time of death
around 10:30.
</p>

<p>
Would you mind telling me
where you were at that time?
</p>

<p>
Riley, you don't have to
answer that question.
</p>

<p>
David, I don't mind
answering the question.
</p>

<p>
The fact is, Lieutenant,
</p>

<p>
I don't&#x2026; I don't know
where I was.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it's true.
I saw Allen last night,
</p>

<p>
briefly, at a press party.
</p>

<p>
We had some words,
not important,
</p>

<p>
but I was very upset by it.
</p>

<p>
I drove around.
I'd been drinking quite a bit.
</p>

<p>
I don't remember
anything about last night.
</p>

<p>
Poor Allen.
</p>

<p>
I wonder if you can
identify this key.
</p>

<p>
No.
</p>

<p>
Would you mind
taking a closer look at it?
</p>

<p>
All keys look alike to me.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir. But I believe
this is your key.
</p>

<p>
The building superintendent
told me
</p>

<p>
that Mr. Mallory's office
</p>

<p>
was leased
18 months ago by you.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the two keys
that he gave you.
</p>

<p>
If you say so.
</p>

<p>
Get to the point, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
We found this key
on the office floor,
</p>

<p>
a few feet from
Mr. Mallory's body.
</p>

<p>
Evidently, it belongs to him.
</p>

<p>
No, sir. We checked
the victim's key ring,
</p>

<p>
and the one that fit
the outer door
</p>

<p>
was on his person.
</p>

<p>
This key, your key,
</p>

<p>
this is the fellow
that bothers me.
</p>

<p>
I've already told you,
</p>

<p>
I don't know
anything about it.
</p>

<p>
What bothers you
about it, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
How it got there?
</p>

<p>
Could have been
dropped days before.
</p>

<p>
Do you own a.38
Smith &amp; Wesson revolver?
</p>

<p>
Now, just a minute.
</p>

<p>
David,
I have nothing to hide.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I do own a pistol,
</p>

<p>
but I don't know
what make it is.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
why are you asking me
</p>

<p>
all these questions?
</p>

<p>
Oh, surely you don't believe
I had anything to do
</p>

<p>
with Allen's death?
</p>

<p>
Well, obviously, some thief
broke into the office
</p>

<p>
when Allen was working.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing to steal.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mallory's wallet
wasn't disturbed.
</p>

<p>
And you just said that
you were drinking last night.
</p>

<p>
You can't explain
your whereabouts
</p>

<p>
at the time of the death.
</p>

<p>
Riley, I'm sorry.
I must insist you
answer no more questions,
</p>

<p>
at least until we've
had a chance to confer.
</p>

<p>
Officer.
</p>

<p>
That is, unless Lt. Columbo
is placing you under arrest.
</p>

<p>
Arrest? No. No, no.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Greenleaf,
you're free to go.
</p>

<p>
I thought he might be.
</p>

<p>
But I may be asking
some questions later on.
</p>

<p>
Of course.
I'll be at home all day.
</p>

<p>
Dear God. Poor Allen.
</p>

<p>
David,
I just can't believe it.
</p>

<p>
I just can't believe it.
</p>

<p>
(Columbo)
I'm gonna be very honest
with you, Miss McRae.
</p>

<p>
Actually, I'm interested
in the activities of
</p>

<p>
one particular person,
a Mr. Riley Greenleaf.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
Well, you picked a beauty,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
If anybody had it
in for Allen,
</p>

<p>
it was Riley Greenleaf.
</p>

<p>
Really? That seems strange.
</p>

<p>
You know, I spoke to
Mr. Greenleaf
earlier this morning.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to me
like he was genuinely upset,
</p>

<p>
acted like he'd lost
a close friend.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
That's beautiful. Allen was
about to walk out on him,
</p>

<p>
taking a best-selling book
with him.
</p>

<p>
That must have been
the book
</p>

<p>
that Mr. Mallory
was dictating.
</p>

<p>
I see.
</p>

<p>
Gonna walk out
and take the book&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Well, wait a minute now.
</p>

<p>
I'm confused a little bit.
</p>

<p>
Wouldn't these two men
have a contract?
</p>

<p>
Yeah,
but it was about to expire.
</p>

<p>
In three weeks.
</p>

<p>
But still the book
would still belong
</p>

<p>
to Mr. Greenleaf,
wouldn't it?
</p>

<p>
You've got a lot to learn
</p>

<p>
about the publishing business,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Riley Greenleaf
didn't know about that book.
</p>

<p>
Allen never
talked to him about it,
</p>

<p>
and never would,
</p>

<p>
until he was free
of that contract.
</p>

<p>
I see. You mind if I smoke?
</p>

<p>
No.
</p>

<p>
I understand that
Mr. Greenleaf
</p>

<p>
has made threats
against Mr. Mallory.
</p>

<p>
You know anything about that?
</p>

<p>
Last night,
he said some ugly things.
</p>

<p>
He said if Allen
didn't write for him,
</p>

<p>
he wouldn't write for anybody.
</p>

<p>
He said that?
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
But&#x2026; But don't take
my word for it,
</p>

<p>
there were a lot of
witnesses there.
</p>

<p>
No kidding.
</p>

<p>
Hmm.
</p>

<p>
(David)
The fact they questioned you
in a state of fatigue
</p>

<p>
opens the doors to
a serious consideration
</p>

<p>
of involuntary
self-incrimination.
</p>

<p>
On that basis alone,
I'm sure we could&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
David,
would you please shut up?
</p>

<p>
You don't seem to realize
that Allen is dead,
</p>

<p>
and I may be
the one who killed him.
</p>

<p>
I'd keep that opinion to
myself if I were you, Riley.
</p>

<p>
A Lt. Columbo to see you, sir.
</p>

<p>
Yes, ask him to come in.
Thank you, Edwards.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Riley, you don't understand.
</p>

<p>
I'm as upset as you are
about Allen's death.
</p>

<p>
But you must not say
anything that could be
</p>

<p>
construed as
an admission of guilt.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Lieutenant,
</p>

<p>
I'd like to apologize
for this morning, but I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I must tell you honestly,
</p>

<p>
I don't remember
a thing about last night.
</p>

<p>
I understand, sir.
</p>

<p>
Forgive the condition
of the room,
</p>

<p>
but I'm redecorating.
</p>

<p>
(David)
More questions, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Or are you here to press
some kind of charges?
</p>

<p>
Well, sir, you see,
we traced the gun.
</p>

<p>
My gun.
It was my gun, wasn't it?
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir, we were able
to trace it to you.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I knew that.
</p>

<p>
When I looked in the car,
in the glove compartment,
</p>

<p>
I saw that my gun was missing.
</p>

<p>
Well,
obviously someone stole it.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't look
that way, sir.
</p>

<p>
The only fingerprints
we were able to find
</p>

<p>
on the handle of that gun
were Mr. Greenleaf's.
</p>

<p>
There were no other
prints on the gun.
</p>

<p>
Well, that's it, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
[Sighing]
</p>

<p>
Allen walked out on me,
</p>

<p>
took his latest book
to another publisher,
</p>

<p>
and I suppose
</p>

<p>
in anger, I killed him.
</p>

<p>
Oh, that new book,
I suppose that's a pretty
valuable piece of property.
</p>

<p>
Anything that he wrote
was valuable, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
[Sighing]
</p>

<p>
If anybody was around to write
</p>

<p>
the first genuine
bestseller about Vietnam,
</p>

<p>
it certainly was
Allen Mallory.
</p>

<p>
Is that a fact, really?
</p>

<p>
I was always under
the impression
</p>

<p>
that war stories,
they all went over big.
</p>

<p>
Only our popular wars.
</p>

<p>
30 years ago,
World War II was a goldmine.
</p>

<p>
But Vietnam that's a plague.
</p>

<p>
Hold it. Wait a minute.
</p>

<p>
I'm confused.
Either I'm confused,
</p>

<p>
or somebody's not
telling the truth.
</p>

<p>
I was told, Mr. Greenleaf,
</p>

<p>
that you knew nothing
about the contents
</p>

<p>
of Mr. Mallory's new book.
</p>

<p>
Actually, I don't.
It's just that this morning,
</p>

<p>
listening to
Allen's voice on the tape,
</p>

<p>
didn't he mention something
about Saigon and a war?
</p>

<p>
L&#x2026; I just assumed that&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry, forgive me.
</p>

<p>
Well, this is a puzzler.
</p>

<p>
L&#x2026; I don't know
quite what to say.
</p>

<p>
Do you remember taking
the gun out of your car?
</p>

<p>
No, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Riley, I warned you
not to say anything.
</p>

<p>
Will you please
stay out of this?
</p>

<p>
I can't watch you talk
yourself into a murder charge.
</p>

<p>
You'll do exactly
as I ask you to do,
</p>

<p>
and I pay you handsomely
just for that privilege.
So, please, stay out of it.
</p>

<p>
You say you've always
kept your gun in the car?
</p>

<p>
Yes.
</p>

<p>
Is that the car?
</p>

<p>
It is.
</p>

<p>
May I take a look?
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you'd like.
</p>

<p>
How long has this
lock been broken?
</p>

<p>
Well,
I don't know that it is.
</p>

<p>
It's been jimmied, sir,
and the scratch mark is fresh.
</p>

<p>
[Birds chirping]
</p>

<p>
May I?
</p>

<p>
I think you're
absolutely right, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
I see what you're driving at.
</p>

<p>
You mean that&#x2026; that
someone could have broken
into the car,
</p>

<p>
and that's how
the gun was stolen.
</p>

<p>
It's possible, sir.
</p>

<p>
And the key.
</p>

<p>
Sir?
</p>

<p>
The key to Allen's office,
I kept an extra one here
</p>

<p>
in the glove compartment,
along with the gun.
</p>

<p>
No, it's gone, too.
</p>

<p>
(Edwards)
Mr. Greenleaf?
</p>

<p>
Yes.
</p>

<p>
Telephone, sir.
It's Mr. Trumble.
</p>

<p>
He says it's quite important.
</p>

<p>
David,
would you take the call?
</p>

<p>
I'm in no mood to discuss
insurance, please.
</p>

<p>
I'll have him
call back later.
</p>

<p>
Oh, no, wait.
</p>

<p>
You'd better find out
what he wants.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I guess somebody
gave you a pretty good rap
back here.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah.
That's a beauty, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
That's the first time
I noticed that.
</p>

<p>
No kiddin'.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you,
bodywork like that,
</p>

<p>
gotta run you $100-$150.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
when you own a car like this,
</p>

<p>
it costs that much
merely to raise the hood.
</p>

<p>
No kiddin'.
</p>

<p>
Sure.
</p>

<p>
Listen, my wife's got
a cousin in the Valley,
who owns a body shop,
</p>

<p>
I mean, if you want me
to talk to him&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
That's very decent of you.
</p>

<p>
You see, I have
a cousin in Beverly Hills.
</p>

<p>
He does all my work for me.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, I have some
disappointing news for you.
</p>

<p>
You'll have to stick this
murder on somebody else.
</p>

<p>
Riley's got an alibi that
even he doesn't know about
</p>

<p>
and it's iron-clad.
</p>

<p>
Well, what is it?
</p>

<p>
I mean,
I'm very glad to hear that.
</p>

<p>
At 10:30 last evening,
Riley Greenleaf
</p>

<p>
was involved in
an auto accident
</p>

<p>
in the parking lot
of the Moore Park Inn.
</p>

<p>
(David)
That's in Encino.
</p>

<p>
Encino? What the devil
was I doing there?
</p>

<p>
You were drinking at the bar,
I'm pleased to inform you.
</p>

<p>
Then he was taken to jail,
where he spent
</p>

<p>
most of the evening
in the drunk tank
</p>

<p>
till I got him out.
</p>

<p>
An experience I don't wish
to relive, thank you.
</p>

<p>
Yeah&#x2026; Yeah, son of a gun.
</p>

<p>
Well, I guess that
just about does it.
</p>

<p>
You may say that again.
</p>

<p>
All I can say is,
thank God.
</p>

<p>
[Sniffing]
</p>

<p>
A blackout is
a frightening thing.
</p>

<p>
I must be grateful
to those people
</p>

<p>
for having the good sense
</p>

<p>
to call my
insurance company to report&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
David, do you realize
that if those people
</p>

<p>
had not contacted
Mark Trumble&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
What&#x2026; what would have&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I don't even want
to think about that.
</p>

<p>
That accident there,
that must have been
</p>

<p>
where you damaged
the rear end of your car.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I suppose so.
</p>

<p>
Well, listen, I'd better go
check this thing out.
</p>

<p>
Still, it's funny.
</p>

<p>
(Greenleaf)
What's that, Lieutenant?
</p>

<p>
Fingerprints.
</p>

<p>
The fact that
</p>

<p>
only your fingerprints
were on the gun.
</p>

<p>
Well, listen, I don't
want to impose on you.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much
for the cooperation.
</p>

<p>
Oh, you're more than welcome.
</p>

<p>
Please don't hesitate to call
</p>

<p>
if&#x2026; if there's
anything I can do.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Lt. Columbo.
</p>

<p>
Sir?
</p>

<p>
I suppose you realize
what you almost did?
</p>

<p>
Sir?
</p>

<p>
You were going to arrest him,
weren't you?
</p>

<p>
Well, it did seem to me
</p>

<p>
that&#x2026; that he was
somehow involved.
</p>

<p>
Seemed.
</p>

<p>
When are you
police going to realize
</p>

<p>
that it takes more than
circumstantial evidence
</p>

<p>
to convict a man of a crime?
</p>

<p>
David.
</p>

<p>
Evidence.
</p>

<p>
Find the evidence,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Quit jumping to conclusions
</p>

<p>
and quit trying to
take the easy way.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mr. Chase, uh, one thing.
</p>

<p>
About that accident,
</p>

<p>
do you happen to know
who else was involved?
</p>

<p>
It's a couple from El Monte.
</p>

<p>
Mr. And Mrs. Morgan. Why?
</p>

<p>
Well, you see,
I didn't know, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I just wasn't sure
</p>

<p>
whether it was just
one person in the other car,
</p>

<p>
or whether there was
more than one.
</p>

<p>
And, uh, when&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
No, I was just telling
your attorney
that I wasn't sure
</p>

<p>
whether there was just
one person in the other car
</p>

<p>
or whether there
was more than one.
</p>

<p>
And when you said
that you were relieved
</p>

<p>
that those people,
more than one,
</p>

<p>
when you were relieved
that those people
</p>

<p>
called your insurance man,
</p>

<p>
I thought maybe the blackout
was starting to clear up,
</p>

<p>
and you were beginning
to remember what happened.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he is,
subconsciously.
</p>

<p>
That's probably it.
His subconscious.
</p>

<p>
(Greenleaf)
I don't care what he says,
David.
</p>

<p>
He's a 2-bit writer.
</p>

<p>
You tell him to sign
the writer on that contract,
</p>

<p>
or he's out.
</p>

<p>
Oh, he'll sign it.
He's hungry. Thanks, David.
</p>

<p>
[Intercom buzzing]
</p>

<p>
Yes, Betsy?
</p>

<p>
(Betsy)
Mr. Greenleaf,
there's a strange man
</p>

<p>
wandering around
the editorial section.
</p>

<p>
I thought you should know.
</p>

<p>
What do you want me to do?
</p>

<p>
You want to get rid of him,
call the police.
</p>

<p>
That's just it.
He says he is the police.
</p>

<p>
Look, you're not supposed to
wrestle her to the deck.
</p>

<p>
You're supposed to make her
swoon with passion.
</p>

<p>
Now give it to me.
Give it to me.
</p>

<p>
His T-shirt smells.
</p>

<p>
His T-shirt smells?
Your T-shirt smells?
</p>

<p>
Columbo,
</p>

<p>
would you please tell me
what you're doing here?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I see you're free, sir.
</p>

<p>
The receptionist told me
you were tied up,
</p>

<p>
so I decided
to wander around.
</p>

<p>
I hope you don't mind.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I'm afraid I do mind.
</p>

<p>
My people happen
to be very busy.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir. I can see that.
I'm very sorry.
</p>

<p>
What are they doing in there?
</p>

<p>
Oh, we're shooting a cover
for a new paperback.
</p>

<p>
It's on anthropology.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Mr. Greenleaf,
I came by to tell you that
</p>

<p>
I've checked out
that accident,
</p>

<p>
and there's no
question about it.
</p>

<p>
You were there.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I can't tell you how
relieved I am to hear that.
</p>

<p>
I'm&#x2026; I'm sorry I yelled.
</p>

<p>
The only thing
I have to do now, sir,
</p>

<p>
is try and find
the person who framed you.
</p>

<p>
Frame me?
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir. It was a frame.
</p>

<p>
No question about it.
</p>

<p>
The fingerprints on the gun,
</p>

<p>
too perfect,
not smudged at all.
</p>

<p>
Now since we know that
you didn't shoot Mr. Mallory
</p>

<p>
that means that
whoever fired that pistol
</p>

<p>
was very careful not to
disturb your fingerprints.
</p>

<p>
I just can't believe that.
</p>

<p>
Oh, it's
a frightening thought,
all right.
</p>

<p>
But you know,
you were very lucky,
</p>

<p>
I mean with that accident.
</p>

<p>
I mean, the time it happened
and the witnesses.
</p>

<p>
Count your blessings, sir.
</p>

<p>
You know, if it hadn't been
for that accident,
</p>

<p>
things would've looked
very bad for you now.
</p>

<p>
You know, uh, lookin' at
some of these posters
</p>

<p>
got me thinkin'.
</p>

<p>
They got a guy
down at the department
</p>

<p>
who wrote a couple of books.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you've heard of him.
</p>

<p>
What's his name?
</p>

<p>
Yes, I know who you mean,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
You know,
he's only a sergeant
</p>

<p>
and I've handled
a lot more cases than he has.
</p>

<p>
I was thinkin'&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
That maybe you might
write a book?
</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm not talkin'
about a big book.
</p>

<p>
You know, I mean,
maybe a short book,
</p>

<p>
just to get the hang of it.
Some of my cases.
</p>

<p>
Sure, why not?
</p>

<p>
Except that if you're gonna
write a book,
</p>

<p>
it takes
a certain amount of skill.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I don't expect to be
a great writer
</p>

<p>
like Mr. Mallory
or anything like that. No.
</p>

<p>
Uh, jeez, you know,
that reminds me.
</p>

<p>
He must've been
very valuable to you, sir.
</p>

<p>
The insurance guy told me
</p>

<p>
that you took out
a&#x2026; a life-insurance policy
</p>

<p>
on his life. $1 million?
</p>

<p>
Oh, that's a usual practice
in this business, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
But, as you say,
valuable property.
</p>

<p>
That's right. I forgot
all about the policy.
</p>

<p>
No kidding.
</p>

<p>
That's funny.
According to my notes,
</p>

<p>
the company sent you
a renewal slip last week.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't know
anything about that.
</p>

<p>
We have an accountant
that handles all that stuff.
</p>

<p>
Listen, I certainly hope
</p>

<p>
you get the men
that you're after.
</p>

<p>
If anybody can do it,
you're the man.
</p>

<p>
Oh, thank you, sir.
</p>

<p>
Good luck with that writing,
keep that up. That's good.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I intend to.
</p>

<p>
You know, it's hard
at home with the family.
</p>

<p>
Mmm-hmm. Sure.
</p>

<p>
Oh, listen.
Uh, gee, I almost forgot.
</p>

<p>
There's one thing
about the Mallory case
</p>

<p>
that bothers me.
Maybe you can help me.
</p>

<p>
Um, I cannot figure out
how the murderer
</p>

<p>
got into Mallory's office
</p>

<p>
since the lock wasn't broken,
</p>

<p>
and there's no sign
of forced entry.
</p>

<p>
With the key.
</p>

<p>
The one that you
found on the floor.
</p>

<p>
The one that was stolen
from my glove compartment.
</p>

<p>
You mean&#x2026; You mean this key?
</p>

<p>
There it is.
</p>

<p>
No.
</p>

<p>
No, I guess this was
part of the frame-up.
</p>

<p>
This key
doesn't fit the lock.
</p>

<p>
I found out that
Mallory changed the lock
</p>

<p>
about three weeks ago.
</p>

<p>
He did?
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
I guess he didn't want
anybody goin' in there
</p>

<p>
and lookin' at
what he was writing.
</p>

<p>
Yes, but&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
This key was left there
to incriminate you.
</p>

<p>
No doubt about it.
</p>

<p>
But that still
doesn't tell us how
</p>

<p>
the murderer got
into the office that night.
</p>

<p>
Well, evidently,
Allen must have let him in,
</p>

<p>
opened the door not knowing&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
No, sir.
</p>

<p>
No, that would've been
on the tape-recording.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mallory's voice
was never interrupted.
</p>

<p>
No. Whoever killed him
</p>

<p>
got in without
Mallory's knowledge,
</p>

<p>
sneaked up on him
when he was dictating.
</p>

<p>
It's puzzling, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
Baffling.
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
There has to be another key
to the new lock.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you,
</p>

<p>
if I could find the person
with that new key,
</p>

<p>
I'd find the person
that killed Mr. Mallory.
</p>

<p>
I don't envy you.
</p>

<p>
That is not
an easy assignment.
</p>

<p>
Oh, listen,
you don't have to tell me.
</p>

<p>
Okay.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
All the luck.
</p>

<p>
Thanks.
</p>

<p>
[Phone ringing]
</p>

<p>
Yeah?
</p>

<p>
(Greenleaf)
Hello, Eddie. This is
your publisher calling.
</p>

<p>
It's been three days, skipper.
</p>

<p>
What do you say
we get together?
</p>

<p>
Yes, I know Eddie.
</p>

<p>
Uh, would tonight
be convenient?
</p>

<p>
Your place?
Better tell me where it is.
</p>

<p>
Yeah,
320 Howard, over the garage.
</p>

<p>
What time?
</p>

<p>
Oh, shall we say 2200 hours?
</p>

<p>
You're learnin', skip. Out.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Eddie, out.
</p>

<p>
Hello, Moishe?
It's Riley Greenleaf, here.
</p>

<p>
(Greenleaf)
I'll tell you what,
I need a favor.
</p>

<p>
I need to have
a key made for a door
</p>

<p>
to a certain office building.
</p>

<p>
Problem is,
I need it this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
You think you can swing that?
</p>

<p>
Oh, fine.
</p>

<p>
Tell him I'll make it
worth his while.
</p>

<p>
[Knocking on door]
</p>

<p>
Yo, it's open.
</p>

<p>
Hey.
Hi.
</p>

<p>
I've been meaning to ask you,
</p>

<p>
all this stuff that you
keep here in your&#x2026; your home,
</p>

<p>
is it legal?
</p>

<p>
It's all made
in the U.S. Of A.
Pull up a sofa.
</p>

<p>
Oh, hey!
</p>

<p>
I made some drawings today
</p>

<p>
for my chapter on
Bouncin' Betties.
</p>

<p>
You did? Fine.
</p>

<p>
What's a Bouncing Betty?
</p>

<p>
Anti-personnel mine.
</p>

<p>
You got to really plant
these things just right.
</p>

<p>
Now you see, you lay it
down six inches. No more.
</p>

<p>
You leave the pressure plate
</p>

<p>
with just about a half inch
of dirt and leaves.
</p>

<p>
The guy steps on it. Whammo!
</p>

<p>
You get the legs.
It's beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah. That's beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Well,
it calls for a celebration.
</p>

<p>
A little&#x2026; little drinking?
</p>

<p>
Hey, that's nice.
Real champagne?
</p>

<p>
Absolutely.
</p>

<p>
Nothing but
the best for Eddie Kane, huh?
</p>

<p>
I'll have to
get used to that idea.
</p>

<p>
You should, Eddie.
</p>

<p>
[Champagne cork pops]
After all, you deserve it.
</p>

<p>
Perfect.
</p>

<p>
A toast, Eddie.
Shall we say, uh,
</p>

<p>
bombs away?
</p>

<p>
Bombs away? I like it.
I like it. Right on.
</p>

<p>
Mmm.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, there we are.
</p>

<p>
I've been meaning to ask you,
</p>

<p>
did you run into any problems
the other night?
</p>

<p>
No.
</p>

<p>
No trouble getting into
Mallory's office?
</p>

<p>
The door was open,
but I left the key
</p>

<p>
on the floor anyway,
like you told me.
</p>

<p>
Splendid,
now about the book.
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Is there any information
contained in the book,
</p>

<p>
that could be
in violation of
</p>

<p>
military requirements
or&#x2026; or defense secrets?
</p>

<p>
Are you kidding me?
</p>

<p>
All the specifications
</p>

<p>
are in
the manufacturer's brochure.
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
All I'm doin' with my book
</p>

<p>
is to say
how to use them right.
</p>

<p>
I've got ideas for bombs
</p>

<p>
those guys never even
thought of.
</p>

<p>
Here.
</p>

<p>
Never even thought of.
</p>

<p>
I got&#x2026; got this funny&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Something the matter, Eddie?
</p>

<p>
L&#x2026; I don't know, I&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
[crashing]
</p>

<p>
[Keys rattling]
</p>

<p>
Dear Mr. Greenleaf.
</p>

<p>
[Typing]
</p>

<p>
[Engine starting]
</p>

<p>
[Explosion in distance]
</p>

<p>
[Screeching]
</p>

<p>
Is this the right place?
</p>

<p>
For what?
</p>

<p>
To park the car.
</p>

<p>
Permanently?
</p>

<p>
No, I'm going in to lunch.
</p>

<p>
[Honking horn]
</p>

<p>
(parking attendant)
Hi, Sharon.
</p>

<p>
Hi. How are you?
</p>

<p>
Good to see you.
</p>

<p>
Oh, thank you.
</p>

<p>
Thanks a lot, Rocco.
</p>

<p>
You're welcome.
</p>

<p>
Excuse me,
don't I need a parking check?
</p>

<p>
Listen, mister,
I'll remember your car.
</p>

<p>
[People chattering]
</p>

<p>
May I help you?
</p>

<p>
Uh, thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
Excuse me, Mr. Neal?
</p>

<p>
Yes?
</p>

<p>
I'm&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey,
this is Lt. Columbo.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes,
would you like to sit down?
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
I don't want to bother you.
</p>

<p>
I called your office and they
told me you were over here.
</p>

<p>
L&#x2026; I hope you don't mind.
</p>

<p>
Oh, no. No, not at all.
</p>

<p>
Will you have
something to eat?
</p>

<p>
Oh, no.
</p>

<p>
Please&#x2026; Please join us.
</p>

<p>
Well, listen,
now that you mentioned it,
</p>

<p>
I could use somethin', so&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Charles, see what
the Lieutenant will have.
</p>

<p>
Big menu.
</p>

<p>
Uh, Sweetbreads Financier&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Can't pronounce that.
</p>

<p>
The Trout Amandine
is very good.
</p>

<p>
Amandine. What is that with?
That's with&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Almonds.
</p>

<p>
With almonds. Fish.
</p>

<p>
Well,
I was thinkin' of somethin'
</p>

<p>
a little bit more, with body.
</p>

<p>
I'll tell you what,
</p>

<p>
if you don't mind,
do you have any chili?
</p>

<p>
Chili?
</p>

<p>
Yeah,
with beans or without beans,
</p>

<p>
either way, it doesn't
make any difference.
</p>

<p>
Chili.
</p>

<p>
Ask Henri to see what he can
do for our friend here.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
I'll have a little
iced tea with that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Neal, uh, what I wanted
to ask you was&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
How are you doin'?
</p>

<p>
Fine, sir.
</p>

<p>
This is what I wanted
to ask you, Mr. Neal.
</p>

<p>
I understand that
your attorneys
are tryin' to get
</p>

<p>
a release of
Mr. Mallory's manuscript.
</p>

<p>
Yes, 60 MILES TO SAIGON.
</p>

<p>
I agreed to publish it
</p>

<p>
after Mallory's contract
expired with Greenleaf.
</p>

<p>
And I want to get hold of it
before he can,
</p>

<p>
because, well, I'm afraid
he's going to make trouble.
</p>

<p>
It's a very valuable book?
</p>

<p>
We think so. After all,
the man has written
</p>

<p>
nothing but bestsellers.
</p>

<p>
Uh, have you read it?
</p>

<p>
Oh, no, nobody's read it.
</p>

<p>
Nobody?
</p>

<p>
Nobody. Of course, Eileen
discussed the end with him.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact,
I believe she even made
a contribution to it.
</p>

<p>
Well,
it was just a little one,
</p>

<p>
believe me, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Pardon me.
</p>

<p>
I'll have a little ketchup.
</p>

<p>
(waiter)
Ketchup?
</p>

<p>
Ketchup.
</p>

<p>
All right, sir.
</p>

<p>
And some crackers.
</p>

<p>
Don't wait for us,
Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
Please eat.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to get those
saltines if he had any.
</p>

<p>
Well&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Neal discussed the book
with Universal Studios.
</p>

<p>
They wanted
a picture for Rock Hudson.
</p>

<p>
The only trouble
with that was that
</p>

<p>
Allen was planning
to kill the hero off
</p>

<p>
in the final pages.
</p>

<p>
Universal said, for $100,000,
</p>

<p>
you don't kill off
Rock Hudson.
</p>

<p>
(Eileen)
As I understood it,
Allen's hero was a P.O.W.
</p>

<p>
Who betrayed his own men,
</p>

<p>
but then found his courage,
came back,
</p>

<p>
and helped them escape
from the prison camp.
</p>

<p>
(Neal)
You see, Allen insisted that
his hero had a tragic flaw
</p>

<p>
which classically
ends in death.
</p>

<p>
That's where
Eileen was so helpful.
</p>

<p>
After the escape,
after they get back to Saigon,
</p>

<p>
Rock Hudson says
goodbye to the girl
</p>

<p>
who helped him
regain his courage,
</p>

<p>
says goodbye to
the material world,
</p>

<p>
and goes off to a monastery.
</p>

<p>
Is that good?
</p>

<p>
If it sells, it is.
</p>

<p>
This chili's good,
I'll tell you that.
</p>

<p>
Uh, the question that
comes to mind now is
</p>

<p>
can either one
of you two people
think of someone
</p>

<p>
who might want to
frame Mr. Greenleaf?
</p>

<p>
Frame&#x2026; Frame Riley?
</p>

<p>
That's right, ma'am.
</p>

<p>
That's what I think happened.
</p>

<p>
I think someone's
tryin' to pin
</p>

<p>
this murder on Mr. Greenleaf.
</p>

<p>
But, surely, you don't think
</p>

<p>
that either one of us
had anything&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'm just asking the question,
ma'am.
</p>

<p>
Well,
</p>

<p>
I suppose I
might have a motive,
</p>

<p>
being his competitor.
</p>

<p>
But I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
That's not my style.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, if I wanted
to frame Riley,
</p>

<p>
it certainly wouldn't be for
the death of Allen Mallory,
</p>

<p>
who I very much
wanted to write for us.
</p>

<p>
Oh, that's all right,
I'm practically finished.
</p>

<p>
I'll have a check.
</p>

<p>
Oh, no, Lieutenant,
please, please, be my guest.
</p>

<p>
No, no, uh,
this is department business
</p>

<p>
and when it's
department business,
</p>

<p>
the department pays for it.
</p>

<p>
All right, if you insist.
</p>

<p>
Excuse me, sir.
Are you Lt. Columbo?
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
There's a telephone call
for you, sir.
</p>

<p>
Well, look, uh,
I'll run along.
</p>

<p>
I want to
thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
You've been very hospitable.
</p>

<p>
Good day, sir.
</p>

<p>
Pleasure.
</p>

<p>
(Columbo)
Ma'am.
</p>

<p>
Having a hard time
getting up.
</p>

<p>
Columbo. Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Where?
</p>

<p>
Your check, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Can I borrow a pencil?
</p>

<p>
Got it. Thank you.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
</p>

<p>
$6. Excuse me.
</p>

<p>
No, I think
there's a mistake.
</p>

<p>
I had the chili
and the iced tea.
</p>

<p>
Oh.
</p>

<p>
$6.75?
</p>

<p>
I forgot to add the iced tea.
</p>

<p>
[Crickets chirping]
</p>

<p>
Name of Eddie Kane.
</p>

<p>
Blew himself up last night
with a hand grenade.
</p>

<p>
Real weirdo.
</p>

<p>
Must've been rigging a bomb.
</p>

<p>
A bomb? What for?
</p>

<p>
Don't ask me.
</p>

<p>
Looks like
he's writing a book.
</p>

<p>
"How to Blow Up Anything
in Ten Easy Lessons."
</p>

<p>
The reason I had
Central contact you,
</p>

<p>
you know that
murder downtown?
</p>

<p>
That writer, Mallory?
</p>

<p>
Yeah?
</p>

<p>
We thought we had a case
against the publisher,
Greenleaf?
</p>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
Well,
it may not mean anything,
</p>

<p>
but I found
Kane's address book,
</p>

<p>
and Greenleaf is in it.
</p>

<p>
Riley Greenleaf.
</p>

<p>
Thought it might
be something.
</p>

<p>
You son of a gun.
</p>

<p>
Hmm.
</p>

<p>
You mind if I look around?
</p>

<p>
Go right ahead.
My boys are all through.
</p>

<p>
(Young)
You want a cup of coffee
or somethin'?
</p>

<p>
No, no, thanks.
I just ate.
</p>

<p>
You want some advice?
</p>

<p>
Be careful
where you eat chili.
</p>

<p>
Why? Too hot?
</p>

<p>
Too high.
</p>

<p>
Wait a minute.
</p>

<p>
(Young)
What?
</p>

<p>
I'll be a son of a gun.
</p>

<p>
I can't believe it.
</p>

<p>
"60 MILES TO SAIGON."
</p>

<p>
Outline for a novel.
</p>

<p>
You think that
ties Eddie Kane
</p>

<p>
with the Mallory murder?
</p>

<p>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
Could be.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
you sure are lucky sometimes.
</p>

<p>
That's me. I'm lucky.
</p>

<p>
You didn't happen
to find a key chain
</p>

<p>
on this fellow, did you?
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, we did.
</p>

<p>
You didn't happen
to find a key
</p>

<p>
that doesn't fit
anything in this place?
</p>

<p>
[Keys rattling]
Well,
there's one for the door,
</p>

<p>
one for his car,
and this one.
</p>

<p>
Who knows?
</p>

<p>
[Laughing]
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah.
</p>

<p>
[Riley continues laughing]
</p>

<p>
Excuse me, Mr. Greenleaf?
</p>

<p>
Shh!
</p>

<p>
Excuse me.
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry to disturb
your movie, Mr. Greenleaf,
</p>

<p>
but this is very important.
</p>

<p>
We found the man
that killed Mr. Mallory.
</p>

<p>
Want to save it, Andy?
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, uh,
he was killed last night.
</p>

<p>
His name was Eddie Kane.
</p>

<p>
He was killed?
</p>

<p>
Yes, there was
some kind of an accident.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to be
fooling around
</p>

<p>
with a homemade bomb.
</p>

<p>
Hmm. Sounds gruesome.
</p>

<p>
It was.
</p>

<p>
Uh, for the purposes of
my report,
</p>

<p>
I wonder if you could tell me
a little bit more about him.
</p>

<p>
Me? I never heard of the man.
</p>

<p>
Well, now,
that's strange, sir,
</p>

<p>
because your telephone
number and your name
</p>

<p>
we found in his
address book.
</p>

<p>
That's bizarre.
</p>

<p>
I don't know
how he obtained it.
</p>

<p>
I've never heard
of any Eddie Kane.
</p>

<p>
Now,
that's just not true, sir.
</p>

<p>
I, myself, went through
his file drawer
</p>

<p>
and I found a duplicate
of a letter from Kane
</p>

<p>
addressed to you,
written nine months ago.
</p>

<p>
Had to do with a novel
called 60 MILES TO SAIGON.
</p>

<p>
He was offering to write it.
</p>

<p>
He also enclosed an outline.
</p>

<p>
Now, that was the name
of Mr. Mallory's new book,
wasn't it?
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't know, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
He never discussed
the book with me.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Greenleaf, the point is,
</p>

<p>
have you heard of
Mr. Kane, or haven't you?
</p>

<p>
And I think you have.
</p>

<p>
And I think you ought to
tell me about it.
</p>

<p>
You could do it here,
</p>

<p>
or you can do it
at headquarters.
</p>

<p>
All right, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
[Sighing]
</p>

<p>
I never was
a very good liar.
</p>

<p>
You might just want
to know the truth.
</p>

<p>
Eddie Kane mailed me
this outline last year.
</p>

<p>
And the moment I read it,
I realized it had
</p>

<p>
the makings of
a very commercial book.
</p>

<p>
But I also realized
that Eddie Kane
</p>

<p>
was not the guy
to write it.
</p>

<p>
I mean,
he simply wasn't a writer.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Allen was
looking around for a new idea.
</p>

<p>
When I showed him this,
he jumped at it.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant,
I was not trying to steal it.
</p>

<p>
Quite the contrary.
I offered Eddie Kane $5,000
for it.
</p>

<p>
He refused.
He was like a wild man.
</p>

<p>
He was insulting, abusive&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But you didn't
return the outline?
</p>

<p>
It was too late then.
</p>

<p>
Allen was already
at work on the book.
</p>

<p>
So what did Mr. Kane do?
</p>

<p>
He threatened me,
threatened Allen, too.
</p>

<p>
I tried to reason with him.
</p>

<p>
I even offered him
part of my profits,
</p>

<p>
but he was adamant.
</p>

<p>
I never thought
he'd be crazy enough to&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I guess he killed Allen
and he tried to frame me.
</p>

<p>
You know, in many ways,
I'm really to blame.
</p>

<p>
Well, I can understand
how you feel, sir.
</p>

<p>
I mean, that wasn't
exactly an ethical thing
</p>

<p>
that you did, was it?
</p>

<p>
No, no, it wasn't.
</p>

<p>
All right, Mr. Greenleaf,
I'll be running along then.
</p>

<p>
Oh, you don't mind if I
take this outline with me?
</p>

<p>
I just wanna
take it to the lab
</p>

<p>
and have them
check the typing
</p>

<p>
against Eddie Kane's
typewriter.
</p>

<p>
No, of course.
You understand?
</p>

<p>
Oh, sure.
</p>

<p>
Good day, sir.
</p>

<p>
Good day, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Feel better.
</p>

<p>
Thanks very much.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I don't have to
read anymore, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
This is the outline
for Allen's book.
</p>

<p>
I can't believe it.
</p>

<p>
He wouldn't plagiarize this,
he wouldn't have to.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm sure
you're right, ma'am,
</p>

<p>
but I double-checked
with the lab.
</p>

<p>
That synopsis was
definitely typed
</p>

<p>
on Eddie Kane's typewriter.
</p>

<p>
Well, l&#x2026; I wish I could
help you, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
L&#x2026; I guess I can't.
</p>

<p>
All right,
thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate your time.
</p>

<p>
Sorry.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Yes?
</p>

<p>
Your evidence.
</p>

<p>
Oh.
</p>

<p>
I get preoccupied,
I forget my head.
</p>

<p>
You know, that synopsis,
</p>

<p>
it's as though
Allen dictated it himself.
</p>

<p>
Wait a minute. Maybe he did.
</p>

<p>
[Muttering]
</p>

<p>
May I use your telephone?
</p>

<p>
Sure.
</p>

<p>
Could you do one more thing?
</p>

<p>
Could you finish
reading that?
</p>

<p>
I don't understand.
</p>

<p>
Please, ma'am.
Would you just read it?
</p>

<p>
(Greenleaf)
You did find the key?
</p>

<p>
On Eddie Kane's key ring, huh?
</p>

<p>
Well, you should be
very happy, Lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
When? Now?
</p>

<p>
Tonight?
</p>

<p>
May I ask, why there?
</p>

<p>
Yes, of course.
I'll come right away.
</p>

<p>
(Columbo)
Good evening,
Mr. Greenleaf.
</p>

<p>
[Typewriter clacking]
</p>

<p>
You writing the great
American novel, Lieutenant,
</p>

<p>
or just boning up
on the touch system?
</p>

<p>
I want to tell you something,
</p>

<p>
this writing is not
as easy as it looks.
</p>

<p>
You know, uh,
I was on a case once.
</p>

<p>
A candidate for
the United States Senate.
</p>

<p>
He had a lot of
security men around him
</p>

<p>
'cause there'd been threats
against his life.
</p>

<p>
Now, in order to shake
the security men,
</p>

<p>
he changes clothes
with his campaign manager.
</p>

<p>
Then he shoots
the campaign manager
</p>

<p>
and he makes it look like
an attempt on his life.
</p>

<p>
Now,
that's a heck of a story.
</p>

<p>
There's only one problem,
I was telling my wife.
</p>

<p>
I got it all up here,
I can't put it down here.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant, very frankly,
</p>

<p>
I don't give a damn about
your senator or your story.
</p>

<p>
Now, look,
I've got people coming over
to my house tonight.
</p>

<p>
Just exactly
what is your problem?
</p>

<p>
Oh, forgive me, sir.
</p>

<p>
I didn't know you were
expecting guests.
</p>

<p>
Did I tell you
</p>

<p>
that the key
that was on the floor
</p>

<p>
next to the body
didn't fit the lock?
</p>

<p>
Yes, you mentioned it
the other day.
</p>

<p>
You said that there
had to be another key
</p>

<p>
to fit the new lock,
and when you had that key,
</p>

<p>
then you'd have the person
who murdered Allen Mallory.
</p>

<p>
Right. Right. I knew I
only told one person,
</p>

<p>
I wasn't sure who.
</p>

<p>
But it was you?
</p>

<p>
Yes, it was me.
</p>

<p>
And now you just
tell me on the telephone,
</p>

<p>
you found that key,
it was on Eddie Kane.
</p>

<p>
Right, we found it.
Here it is.
</p>

<p>
But there's a problem.
</p>

<p>
Well, what's the problem?
Doesn't the key fit the lock?
</p>

<p>
No, it fits, the key fits,
</p>

<p>
fits like a glove.
</p>

<p>
All right,
there's your answer.
</p>

<p>
Then obviously,
that's the key
</p>

<p>
that Eddie Kane used
the night he came in here.
</p>

<p>
No, that would be impossible.
</p>

<p>
Why?
</p>

<p>
Officer,
would you bring in Mr. Black?
</p>

<p>
Just wouldn't be possible.
</p>

<p>
Look, forgive me for&#x2026; for
seeming dumb about this thing,
</p>

<p>
but I just don't understand.
</p>

<p>
You've just shown me a key
that fits that lock.
</p>

<p>
Right. Right, sir.
It does fit.
</p>

<p>
Good evening, Mr. Black.
</p>

<p>
But, uh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
that lock wasn't
on the door that night.
</p>

<p>
Oh, Mr. Black, Mr. Greenleaf.
</p>

<p>
Yeah. How do you do?
</p>

<p>
How do you do?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Black is a locksmith.
</p>

<p>
Right.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Black,
</p>

<p>
would you tell Mr. Greenleaf
</p>

<p>
when you put this lock
on this door?
</p>

<p>
(Mr. Black)
Oh, that&#x2026; that was Thursday.
</p>

<p>
That was the day
after that writer,
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mallory, was shot.
</p>

<p>
The day after?
</p>

<p>
I don't understand that.
</p>

<p>
Who ordered you
to change the lock?
</p>

<p>
He did.
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir. I did.
</p>

<p>
Which raises
a very troublesome question.
</p>

<p>
That will be all, Mr. Black.
</p>

<p>
For the life of me,
I cannot figure out
</p>

<p>
how Eddie Kane would
have a key to a lock
</p>

<p>
that was put on the door
on my instructions
</p>

<p>
the day after
he shot Mallory.
</p>

<p>
Does that make
any sense to you?
</p>

<p>
No, not at all.
</p>

<p>
Why would Kane
even come back here?
</p>

<p>
Sure is a puzzle, all right.
</p>

<p>
You don't have any answers?
</p>

<p>
No, not a one.
</p>

<p>
Beats me.
</p>

<p>
Well, thank goodness
I got the answer
</p>

<p>
to the other thing
that was bothering me.
</p>

<p>
What other thing?
</p>

<p>
Well, sir, I know
you're expecting guests,
</p>

<p>
so I don't want to
hold you up anymore.
</p>

<p>
It's true, I do have to leave,
and I haven't got much time.
</p>

<p>
But I am curious. Now, what?
</p>

<p>
As long as
you're curious, sir.
</p>

<p>
I figured out how Eddie Kane
got in here that night.
</p>

<p>
Uh, he didn't use the key
that was removed
</p>

<p>
from your car.
</p>

<p>
Mallory had changed that lock,
</p>

<p>
and, obviously,
he didn't use this key.
</p>

<p>
The fact is,
he didn't use any key.
</p>

<p>
Well,
how did he get in here then?
</p>

<p>
He walked, the door was open.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the door was open?
</p>

<p>
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
You see, the air conditioner
had broken down.
</p>

<p>
That's why
that window was open.
</p>

<p>
You can actually hear
the street noises on the tape.
</p>

<p>
But, you know, an open window
on a muggy night's
</p>

<p>
not much help.
</p>

<p>
So I think Mr. Mallory
must've opened that door.
</p>

<p>
That created a nice
cross breeze here.
</p>

<p>
Now, when Mr. Kane arrived,
</p>

<p>
well, the door was open,
he just walked in.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mallory must've
turned around
</p>

<p>
and he shot him.
</p>

<p>
All right. If that is true,
</p>

<p>
and it sounds
conceivable enough to me,
</p>

<p>
but I don't see
how that changes anything.
</p>

<p>
About what, sir?
</p>

<p>
About what happened.
</p>

<p>
Now, look, Columbo,
I've had you up to here.
</p>

<p>
And frankly, I'm not
interested in locks and keys
</p>

<p>
and open doors
</p>

<p>
and air conditioners,
and how he got in here.
</p>

<p>
What the hell difference
does it make
how he got in here?
</p>

<p>
The fact is that some crackpot
war veteran came in here,
</p>

<p>
shot and killed Allen Mallory,
</p>

<p>
and then frames me
out of some insane belief
</p>

<p>
that Allen and I
stole his lousy little story.
</p>

<p>
Now, that's all I know.
</p>

<p>
And that's all
I'm interested in.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wolpert.
</p>

<p>
I thought that name
might mean something.
</p>

<p>
Let's see
if we're talking about
</p>

<p>
the same Mr. Wolpert.
</p>

<p>
We know you two fellows
know one another,
</p>

<p>
so don't bother to hide it.
</p>

<p>
No, you're wrong,
we don't know each other.
</p>

<p>
This young man may have
seen me going&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
That's a lie.
</p>

<p>
I resent that.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Greenleaf,
</p>

<p>
you told me that
you knew nothing
</p>

<p>
about the contents of
Mr. Mallory's new novel.
</p>

<p>
That's right, I don't.
</p>

<p>
That's another lie.
</p>

<p>
Thank you, Officer.
</p>

<p>
Good evening, Norman.
</p>

<p>
Good evening.
</p>

<p>
I met this young man
the night of the murder.
</p>

<p>
Works for
a manuscript service.
</p>

<p>
Picks up
Mr. Mallory's tapes,
</p>

<p>
takes them to his
company's office,
</p>

<p>
the next day the typist
transcribes the tapes.
</p>

<p>
Then he returns the tapes
and the typed pages.
</p>

<p>
Except for the extra copy
</p>

<p>
which he passed to you.
</p>

<p>
Now, that's nothing
but assumption,
it's pure speculation.
</p>

<p>
I've checked
your bank accounts,
</p>

<p>
you made five
monthly cash deposits
</p>

<p>
of $1,000 each.
</p>

<p>
Now,
a court might want to know
</p>

<p>
where you got that money
on your salary.
</p>

<p>
You look at me.
</p>

<p>
You don't have to
say anything.
</p>

<p>
I'm not talking
about losing your job.
</p>

<p>
I'm talking about murder.
</p>

<p>
Don't you say a word.
I'll call my lawyer.
</p>

<p>
He's involving you
in a murder.
</p>

<p>
Was that part of the deal?
</p>

<p>
Look, um,
I did get a set of the pages
</p>

<p>
to Mr. Greenleaf.
</p>

<p>
But I'm not
involved in any murder.
</p>

<p>
I don't know a thing about
a murder.
</p>

<p>
I believe you.
</p>

<p>
Go on home now,
</p>

<p>
we'll get your statement
later.
</p>

<p>
Thank you.
Go on.
</p>

<p>
All right, Columbo.
</p>

<p>
So he testifies that
he gave me those papers.
</p>

<p>
What's that mean?
</p>

<p>
It means you knew everything
that Mallory was writing.
</p>

<p>
Day by day,
including the ending.
</p>

<p>
Even if I knew the ending,
</p>

<p>
that still doesn't mean
that I was the one
who murdered the man.
</p>

<p>
For $100,000,
</p>

<p>
you don't kill off
Rock Hudson.
</p>

<p>
In this synopsis
that you gave me,
</p>

<p>
which you claim Eddie Kane
wrote nine months ago,
</p>

<p>
the hero saves his men,
</p>

<p>
and he goes off
to live in a monastery.
</p>

<p>
I hate to tell you this, sir,
</p>

<p>
but there is no way
that Eddie Kane
</p>

<p>
could've had that idea.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't even
Allen Mallory's.
</p>

<p>
It was given to him
by his agent, Miss McRae.
</p>

<p>
And for the life of me,
</p>

<p>
I cannot figure out
how Eddie Kane
</p>

<p>
could have written an ending
nine months ago
</p>

<p>
that was only invented
last week.
</p>

<p>
I guess you see my point.
