<h3 id="org4be386a">Phoneme</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4be386a">

A <b>phoneme</b> is the smallest distinctive unit of sound in a language that
can differentiate words and meanings.

<h3 id="org9f53217">Mother Tongue</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9f53217">
<p>
A <b>mother tongue</b> is the first language a person learns from birth,
often used for communication in the home and reflecting one's cultural
and ethnic identity.

<h3 id="org983c41d">Monolingual</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org983c41d">
<p>
A <b>monolingual</b> individual is someone who speaks and understands only
one language.

<h2 id="org59ef992">Preamble</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org59ef992">
<p>
Given that most people are monolingual, it can be quite surprising for
them to discover that different languages exhibit distinct acoustic
characteristics. I.e. each language possesses unique phonemes and
often lacks the phonemes present in other languages.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, if you wish to speak another language and want others to
understand you, it is crucial to first comprehend the phonetic
differences between your mother tongue and the target
language. Additionally, it is essential to learn how to vocalize and
articulate the new sounds from the other language.
</p>

<p>
Often, when you attempt to speak another language using the phonemes
of your mother tongue, it can sound quite strange and confusing to
your listeners. Moreover in most cases it sounds so puzzling that they
can't understand you at all.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<b>In other words:</b>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
While it is possible to speak another language using the sounds of
your mother tongue, you may be <i>the only one</i> who understands what
you're talking about.
</p>

<h2 id="orgae6929d">The English Phonemical Hallmarks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgae6929d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>θ</i>: The voiceless dental fricative, as in the word "think."</li>
<li><i>ð</i>: The voiced dental fricative, as in the word "this."</li>
<li><i>ɹ</i>: The post-alveolar approximant, as in the word "red."</li>
<li><i>æ</i>: The near-open front unrounded vowel, as in the word "cat."</li>
<li><i>ʌ</i>: The open-mid back unrounded vowel, as in the word "cup."</li>
<li><i>ŋ</i>: The voiced velar nasal, as in the word "sing."</li>
</ul>

<p>
These phonemes are particularly distinctive in English and can pose
challenges for speakers of other languages when learning English
pronunciation.

<div id="outline-container-org9301c6d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9301c6d">German</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9301c6d">
<p>
Although German and English belong to the same language family, the
phonemic differences are remarkable: German lacks the glottal <code>/r/</code>
sound, the nasal <code>/ŋ/</code>, and <code>/θ/</code> sounds.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, English does not use an explicit <code>/r/</code> sound as pronounced
in certain other languages.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge7262ba" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge7262ba">Russian</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge7262ba">
<p>
Naturally, Russian is phonemically closer to German: it does not
contain the glottal <code>/r/</code> sound, the nasal <code>/ŋ/</code>, or the <code>/θ/</code>
sounds. Additionally, it lacks the <code>/f/</code> sound as well.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, English lacks a range of soft consonants and the unique
phoneme <code>/ɨ/</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0243d04" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0243d04">Portuguese</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0243d04">
<p>
Portuguese includes nasal vowels, such as <code>/ɐ̃/=/, =/ẽ/</code>, and <code>/õ/</code>,
which are absent in English. Portuguese has a range of palatal
consonants like <code>/ʎ/</code> and <code>/ɲ/</code>, which do not occur in English.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, English features the interdental fricatives <code>/θ/</code> and
<code>/ð/</code>, which are not found in Portuguese. English also employs the
rhotic sounds <code>/ɹ/</code> and <code>/ɾ/</code> (in some accents), which differ from the
Portuguese sounds <code>/ʁ/</code> or <code>/ɾ/</code> commonly used in various Portuguese
dialects.
</p>

<p>
The nasal <code>/ŋ/</code> sound, found in English at the end of words like
"sing," does not exist as a distinct phoneme in Portuguese. In
Portuguese, nasal sounds are usually represented by nasal vowels or
are not as consistently produced with a velar nasal as in English.

<div id="outline-container-org288bea6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org288bea6">Arabic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org288bea6">
<p>
Arabic contains emphatic consonants such as <code>/sˤ/</code>, <code>/dˤ/</code>, and
<code>/tˤ/</code>, which have no equivalent in English. Arabic features the
pharyngeal sounds <code>/ʕ/</code> and <code>/ħ/</code> that are absent in English.  The
uvular sounds like <code>/q/</code> and <code>/ʁ/</code> are present in Arabic but not in
standard English.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, English includes the interdental fricatives <code>/θ/</code> and
<code>/ð/</code>, which are not found in Arabic.  English utilizes a broad set of
vowel distinctions, like <code>/ɪ/</code> and <code>/æ/</code>, while Arabic tends to have
fewer distinct vowel sounds.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb0e7438" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb0e7438">Nasal <code>/ŋ/</code> in Arabic</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb0e7438">
<p>
The nasal <code>/ŋ/</code> sound, as in the English word "sing," does not exist
as a distinct phoneme in Arabic. Arabic primarily uses the nasal
sounds <code>/m/</code> and <code>/n/</code>, with no dedicated <code>/ŋ/</code> sound.
