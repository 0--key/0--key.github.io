<b>Radiological Protection</b> is the science and practice of protecting
people and the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing
radiation, while allowing for its beneficial applications.
</p>

<p>
<b>Radiation Protection</b> is the practice of safeguarding people and the
environment from the detrimental effects of ionizing radiation by
implementing protective measures and safety standards.
</p>

<p>
<b>Nuclear Safety</b> is the set of technical and organizational measures
aimed at preventing nuclear accidents and mitigating their potential
consequences to protect people and the environment.
</p>

<p>
<b>Civil Defence</b> in the context of <i>Radiological Protection</i> and
<i>Nuclear Safety</i> involves the preparation, planning, and
implementation of protective actions and emergency response strategies
to safeguard the public and minimize harm during radiological or
nuclear incidents.

<h2 id="org9ee59eb">Preamble</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9ee59eb">
<p>
Although my military specialization in <i>"Protection against
Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Weapons of Mass Destruction,"</i>
acquired in 1999, it is prudent for me to share my perspective on the
potential threats these weapons pose to the citizens of the Republic
of Ireland in 2025.
</p>

<p>
Given the present political tensions between nuclear-armed countries,
the potential threat of their use by combatants and the severe
consequences that would follow is a pressing concern. This precarious
situation underscores the urgent need for comprehensive contingency
planning to mitigate the impact of any nuclear confrontation.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, there is nothing novel under the moon, and the current
geopolitical situation is not unprecedentedâ€”it bears a resemblance to
a distorted version of the Cold War era. Echoes of past tensions are
evident in today's global landscape, reminding us of the cyclical
nature of international relations and the persistent challenges posed
by nuclear deterrence and political rivalry.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, it is sensible to revisit the Civil Defence strategies
employed during that era, adapt them to today's circumstances, and,
where possible, enhance them to meet contemporary challenges.

<h2 id="org355b265">Intro</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org355b265">
<p>
In the current geopolitical climate, characterized by heightened
political tensions among nations that possess nuclear arsenals, the
risk of the intentional or accidental release of radioactive materials
on a global scale is a concerning reality. Although the probability of
such an event remains low, <i>it is not negligible</i> and requires closer
attention to be paid to the issue in the face of potential nuclear
threats in general, and in the context of Civil Defence in particular.

</div>

<p>
In the USSR, Civil Defence was institutionally established by the
Soviet government around a century ago as a critical component of
national security, underscored by comprehensive legal frameworks. It
was intricately rooted in the nation's commitment to safeguarding its
citizens, as delineated in the law, and was viewed as a fundamental
extension of the Constitutional <i>right to life</i>.

<h3 id="org6d8603c">Ideology</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d8603c">
<p>
The implementation of Civil Defence measures was designed to provide
robust protection for the populace against a range of potential
threats, including nuclear, chemical, and other emergencies,
reflecting the state's prioritization of citizens' safety and
resilience through well-orchestrated preparedness strategies and
initiatives.

<h3 id="org94e5024">Law</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org94e5024">
<p>
It follows logically that, with the Soviet government's extensive
dedication to safeguarding the life and health of its citizens, a
comprehensive framework for Civil Defence was meticulously crafted and
enshrined in a broad array of laws and regulatory acts. This legal
structure was designed to ensure systematic planning, preparedness,
and response capabilities to effectively protect the population from
various emergencies, including potential nuclear and radiological
threats.
</p>

<p>
The detailed codification of Civil Defence measures underscores the
importance placed on citizen safety as a national priority, reflecting
thorough government planning and strategic foresight.

<h3 id="orgf5ddd88">Upbringing and training</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf5ddd88">
<p>
It is noteworthy that Civil Defence was integrated into the secondary
school curriculum as a dedicated educational subject, consisting of a
weekly one-hour session for <code>13-16-year-old</code> students. This inclusion
reflected the importance placed on equipping young citizens with
essential knowledge and skills in emergency preparedness and response.
</p>

<p>
By introducing these concepts at an early age, the education system
aimed to foster a culture of awareness and resilience, preparing
students to effectively handle potential threats and contribute to
community safety.

<p>
Despite a substantial easing of political tensions between the Soviet
Union and the capitalist world in the late 1980s, which reduced the
likelihood of a nuclear exchange, other threats addressed by Civil
Defence have persisted, if not intensified. Technological accidents,
terrorism, and natural disasters continued to pose significant
challenges, necessitating robust preparedness and response strategies.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org11a9fad">
<p>
Following the fall of the Iron Curtain and the dissolution of the
Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine inherited a well-developed nuclear
industry established during the Soviet Era within its borders. Along
with this industrial legacy, Ukraine also adopted a system of laws and
regulatory acts that have since evolved to become the foundation of
its national nuclear policy framework. This framework has played a
critical role in guiding the safe and efficient management of
Ukraine's nuclear resources, ensuring adherence to international
standards in nuclear safety and radiological protection.
