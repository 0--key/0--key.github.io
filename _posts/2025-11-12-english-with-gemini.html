<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0895353">
<p>
Nowadays, it is quite easy to use the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/">Internet</a> to hunt for the meaning
of a word: simply find your word used in a quote by someone famously
wise and look it up.

<li><p>
"The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of
getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into
small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one."
</p>

<p>
This advice is both practical and motivational, emphasizing the
power of initiative and incremental progress.
</p></li>

<li><p>
"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things
that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the
bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in
your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."
</p>

<p>
This encourages a proactive and adventurous approach to life,
urging people to embrace opportunities and experiences."
</p></li>

<li><p>
"Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can
see."
</p>

<p>
It speaks to the universal power of compassion and empathy,
transcending physical limitations and fostering human connection."
</p></li>

<li><p>
"Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time
to pause and reflect."
</p>

<p>
This quote invites critical thinking and the courage to challenge
conformity, encouraging individuals to consider their unique
perspectives."
</p></li>

<li><p>
"The most interesting information comes from children, for they
tell all they know and then stop."
</p>

<p>
This humorously highlights the straightforwardness and honesty of
children, offering insight into a simple, unfiltered worldview."
</p></li>

<li><p>
"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of
fear."
</p>

<p>
This distinguishes between the absence of fear and the conscious
effort to confront and manage it, a valuable lesson in facing
life's challenges."
</p></li>

<li><p>
"The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot
read."
</p>

<p>
It underscores the importance of reading and education, suggesting
that neglecting to learn is akin to being unable to learn."

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to
continue that counts. It means that every achievement is just a
step in a longer journey and that setbacks are not the end but
rather opportunities to gather strength and persist."</li>

<li>"To each, there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they
are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to
do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their
talents. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or
unqualified for that which could have been their finest hour."</li>

<li>"We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing
grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall
fight in the hills; we shall never surrender. This powerful
encouragement exemplifies the unwavering resolve and determination
needed in the face of adversity."</li>

<li>"The empires of the future are the empires of the mind. It
underscores the importance of intellectual power, creativity, and
innovation in shaping the future, emphasizing how mental and
educational achievements define real power."</li>

<li>"When you have to kill a man, it costs nothing to be polite. This
rhetorical remark suggests that civility should be maintained
regardless of the situation, subtly highlighting the value of
maintaining one's dignity and politeness."</li>

<li>"It is not enough that we do our best; sometimes we must do what is
required. This speaks to going beyond personal limits and striving
to meet the demands of a situation, showing dedication and
responsibility."</li>

<li>"Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also
what it takes to sit down and listen. It highlights the dual nature
of courage, not just in expressing oneself but also in listening
and understanding others."</li>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. Those who are
victorious in war cannot find it; those who conquer only themselves
can. True serenity is found through internal harmony and
self-understanding, rather than external achievements."</li>

<li>"Holding onto anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of
throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned. This
teaching emphasizes the self-harm caused by harboring resentment
and the importance of letting go for personal peace."</li>

<li>"Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without
a spiritual life. It implies that for a fulfilling life, nurturing
spiritual awareness and growth is as crucial as tending to physical
needs."</li>

<li>"Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the
truth. This illustrates the inevitability of truth prevailing, much
like the certainty of day and night following one another."</li>

<li>"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate
the mind on the present moment. Focusing on the present enables one
to fully engage with life, rather than being consumed by regrets or
worries about what has yet to come."</li>

<li>"We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the
mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves. It
highlights the power of positive thinking and the impact of mental
purity on realizing happiness."</li>

<li>"The tongue like a sharp knife&#x2026; Kills without drawing blood. This
highlights the significant impact of words, cautioning against
harmful speech and emphasizing verbal kindness."</li>
