Christopher Alexander says,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in
our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that
problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times
over, without ever doing it the same way twice”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even though Alexander was talking about patterns in buildings and
towns, what he says is true about object-oriented design patterns. Our
solutions are expressed in terms of objects and interfaces instead of
walls and doors, but at the core of both kinds of patterns is a
solution to a problem in a context.

<p>
is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions,
and consequences in a word or two. Naming a pattern
immediately increases our design vocabulary. It lets us design at a
higher level of abstraction. Having a vocabulary for patterns lets us
talk about them with our colleagues, in our documentation, and even
to ourselves. It makes it easier to think about designs and to
communicate them and their trade-offs to others. Finding good names
has been one of the hardest parts of developing our catalog.

<p>
It explains the problem and its context. It might describe specific
design problems such as how to represent algorithms as objects. It
might describe class or object structures that are symptomatic of
an inflexible design. Sometimes the problem will include a list of
conditions that must be met before it makes sense to apply the
pattern.

<p>
describes the elements that make up the design, their
relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations. The solution
doesn’t describe a particular concrete design or implementation,
because a pattern is like a template that can be applied in many
different situations. Instead, the pattern provides an abstract
description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of
elements (classes and objects in our case) solves it.

<p>
are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern. Though
consequences are often unvoiced when we describe design decisions,
they are critical for evaluating design alternatives and for
understanding the costs and benefits of applying the pattern.
</p>

<p>
The consequences for software often concern space and time
trade-offs. They may address language and implementation issues as
well. Since reuse is often a factor in object-oriented design, the
consequences of a pattern include its impact on a system’s
flexibility, extensibility, or portability. Listing these
consequences explicitly helps you understand and evaluate them.
