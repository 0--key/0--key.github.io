In 1976, the economist and historian Carlo M. Cipolla (1922–2000)
wrote an essay titled “The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity” where he
defines the five “laws of stupidity” as:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid
individuals in circulation;
</p>

<p>
The compilers of the Testament were aware of the First Basic Law,
and they paraphrased it when they asserted that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“stultorum infinitus est numerus”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But they indulged in <i>poetic exaggeration</i>. The number of stupid
people cannot be infinite because the number of living people is
finite.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The probability that a certain person will be stupid is independent
of any other characteristic of that person;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A stupid man is born a stupid man by an act of Providence.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or
a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly
incurring losses;

<li>Nonstupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid
individuals;</li>
<li>A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.</li>
</ol>
